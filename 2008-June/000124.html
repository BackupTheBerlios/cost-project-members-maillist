<PRE>Dear all,

prior to the meeting and summarising the latest discussions in the 
mailing list, in the forum and in multilateral correspondance, here are 
the issues to be discussed regarding the COST-FF Data Exchange Format :

* the major discussion is about the sex field in hl table. The issue is 
about extending this concept to other possibilities than F/M and also 
extending the concept to take into consideration the taxa in a sampled box.
The system today is that a given hh$staNum or hh$trpCode is documented 
with sl$spp related to cl$spp and ce$spp at the population level. for 
this sl$spp we may have different sexes (case of Nephrops) registered in 
hl$sex.
The first problem is that we don't have the sampled weight per sex. It's 
not a problem to estimate the total number and the total length 
structure per sex, but how do we calculate the total weight per sex?
The second point is about burried Nephrops. I must say I don't see where 
is the problem here. The field is optional for unsexed and, unless I 
miss something, you cannot sex the burried Nephrops? Do we open this 
field to other occurences? B(urried), ...
The third point is about extending the concept of sex to taxa because 
for me it is the same issue for raising. Some sl$spp (Anglerfish, 
squids, ...) are a mixture of different species in the sampled box. The 
raising must be done at the level of taxon/sex, although we only have 
spp info in cl and ce. If we extend the concept of sex to a field called 
taxon which would include the sex, it can be a way out to this. This 
field would be optional in case of similarity with hl$spp.

* including survey data in COST, and in particular DATRAS data. We only 
need this information for stock-related variables (sex-ratio, maturity, 
individual weight, age-at-length). The principle agreed at the beginning 
of the project is that the ca table would be attached to tr only , same 
as for the purchase of fish. In the ca table we made sure we had all the 
information needed like time strata (quarter, month) and space strata 
(area, rectangle). I understand that by doing so we do not include the 
DATRAS data as such in COST but COST is not meant to calculate survey 
indices. During this project we should stick to this, although there are 
ca fields that can be used to link ca to hh and/or sl if needed (staNum, 
sex, ...), but this should not be the rule.

* some minor issues like
    - should vessel type (tr) be mandatory or optional. IMO what should 
be mandatory are the fields essential to the estimation of the variables 
and their precision. COST is not a database. Following this, vessel type 
should not be mandatory.

    - should gear (hh) corresponds only to the survey gear and not 
commercial where there are two metier fields (field 25 and 26).  Only 
one of these fields is mandatory and it is the metier level 5 (Gear + 
Target Assemblage). In the new DCR Regulation, the level 6 is mandatory 
(Gear + Target Assemblage + Mesh size and selective device). Anyhow, it 
will take time before all the countries are able to document levle 6 for 
all their fisheries. The situation as it is now is a good compromise, 
level 5 is mandatory in cs, cl and ce. Implicitly, this means that you 
have to know the gear to document level 5 for your fisheries. I would 
change nothing here.
 
    - length corresponds only to total length. IMO it is not advisable 
to proceed to transformation of variable prior to use it in COST. I mean 
the length as it is measured will be used in age_length keys and we 
would find the same information both in hl and in ca. Tansforming to 
total length in both ca and hl would lead to errors and increase of 
uncertainty. The solution would be to add a field Length type to hl and 
ca to ensure that they are both compatible.

Probably there are some other issues, so don't hesitate to mention them. 
You may react to my suggestions, especially the FF (not France Football) 
players! The outcome of this discussion and the agreements will be 
summarised in the report of the meeting.

Best regards

Joel
