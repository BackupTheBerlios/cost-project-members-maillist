Subject: [Cost-project-members] Data Exchange Format Request
formodifications


Dear all,

prior to the meeting and summarising the latest discussions in the
mailing list, in the forum and in multilateral correspondance, here are
the issues to be discussed regarding the COST-FF Data Exchange Format :

* the major discussion is about the sex field in hl table. The issue is
about extending this concept to other possibilities than F/M and also
extending the concept to take into consideration the taxa in a sampled
box. 
The system today is that a given hh$staNum or hh$trpCode is documented
with sl$spp related to cl$spp and ce$spp at the population level. for
this sl$spp we may have different sexes (case of Nephrops) registered in
hl$sex. 
The first problem is that we don't have the sampled weight per sex. It's
not a problem to estimate the total number and the total length
structure per sex, but how do we calculate the total weight per sex?
The second point is about burried Nephrops. I must say I don't see where
is the problem here. The field is optional for unsexed and, unless I
miss something, you cannot sex the burried Nephrops? Do we open this
field to other occurences? B(urried), ...
The third point is about extending the concept of sex to taxa because
for me it is the same issue for raising. Some sl$spp (Anglerfish,
squids, ...) are a mixture of different species in the sampled box. The
raising must be done at the level of taxon/sex, although we only have
spp info in cl and ce. If we extend the concept of sex to a field called
taxon which would include the sex, it can be a way out to this. This
field would be optional in case of similarity with hl$spp.

* including survey data in COST, and in particular DATRAS data. We only
need this information for stock-related variables (sex-ratio, maturity,
individual weight, age-at-length). The principle agreed at the beginning
of the project is that the ca table would be attached to tr only , same
as for the purchase of fish. In the ca table we made sure we had all the
information needed like time strata (quarter, month) and space strata
(area, rectangle). I understand that by doing so we do not include the
DATRAS data as such in COST but COST is not meant to calculate survey
indices. During this project we should stick to this, although there are
ca fields that can be used to link ca to hh and/or sl if needed (staNum,
sex, ...), but this should not be the rule.

* some minor issues like
    - should vessel type (tr) be mandatory or optional. IMO what should
be mandatory are the fields essential to the estimation of the variables
and their precision. COST is not a database. Following this, vessel type
should not be mandatory.

    - should gear (hh) corresponds only to the survey gear and not
commercial where there are two metier fields (field 25 and 26).  Only
one of these fields is mandatory and it is the metier level 5 (Gear +
Target Assemblage). In the new DCR Regulation, the level 6 is mandatory
(Gear + Target Assemblage + Mesh size and selective device). Anyhow, it
will take time before all the countries are able to document levle 6 for
all their fisheries. The situation as it is now is a good compromise,
level 5 is mandatory in cs, cl and ce. Implicitly, this means that you
have to know the gear to document level 5 for your fisheries. I would
change nothing here.
 
    - length corresponds only to total length. IMO it is not advisable
to proceed to transformation of variable prior to use it in COST. I mean
the length as it is measured will be used in age_length keys and we
would find the same information both in hl and in ca. Tansforming to
total length in both ca and hl would lead to errors and increase of
uncertainty. The solution would be to add a field Length type to hl and
ca to ensure that they are both compatible.

Probably there are some other issues, so don't hesitate to mention them.
You may react to my suggestions, especially the FF (not France Football)
players! The outcome of this discussion and the agreements will be
summarised in the report of the meeting.

Best regards

Joel

I think it's &quot;berried&quot; Nephrops, that is females carrying eggs on their
abdomen.

Dear All
 
Some additional minor issues:
 
Change:

*	In chapter Data formats - record types - CS data: 
	Commercial samplings all records: 
	o       &quot;Trip number&quot; field: Range changed from &quot;1 to 9999&quot; to
&quot;1 to 999,999&quot;

 Minor clarifications / corrections:

*	Commercial samplings SL record: 
	 1)     Weight field comments section: Text changed from &quot;Weight
of the corresponding stratum (Catch category - Size category - sex)&quot; To
&quot;Weight of the corresponding stratum&quot;. 
	 2)     Weight field comments section: Text changed from &quot;Weight
of the corresponding stratum Catch category - Size category - sex&quot; To
&quot;stratum&quot;. 
	 3)     Comment 2 added below table: &quot;Weight should be equal to
subsample weight when sampling type is &quot;M&quot; or &quot;D&quot; (Condition subject to
check during upload).&quot;
*	Commercial samplings HH record: 
	 1)     Comment 16 below table: Text appended: &quot;(Condition
subject to check during upload).&quot;
*	Commercial samplings CA record: 
	 1)     Comment 3 below table: Text changed from: &quot;Only
applicable for Herring and Whitefish.&quot; To &quot;Only applicable for Herring
(Clupea harengus) and Common whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus).&quot; 
	 2)   New note below table: &quot;The Fishing Activity Categories is
set to the same as given in the first matching HH record for the same
trip. In next version of the exhange format, the three FAC fields should
be added to the CA record. All CA records should match at least one HH
record on VesselFlagCountry, LandingCountry, Year, Quarter, Month, Area
and StatisticalRectangle (Condition subject to check during upload).
(except for CA's from survey data).&quot;
*	 Commercial landings and effort CL + CE records: 
	  1)   Like on the CS.HH record; the field &quot;Fishing activity
category European lvl 5&quot; should be optional, but with the following
comment added: &quot;Either &quot;Fishing activity category European lvl 5&quot; or
&quot;Fishing activity category European lvl 6&quot; should be provided. Not both.
Preferably lvl 6 since this includes the lvl 5 information (Condition
subject to check during upload).&quot;  

Comments to the suggestions in the mail from Joel above will follow...

 

Best regards

Teunis
