<PRE>Hi All
I'm trying to get some FRS observer (discard) data into COST format and
have a query about fitting into the SL table format the subsampling of
the discarded catch. 

At the point at which we sample discards they are unsorted, and a
secondary problem is that the discarded and subsampled fraction are
measured in baskets rather than as an actual weight, though baskets have
a nominal weight. 

So specifically, our sampling protocol is that for each haul we have a
total number of unsorted discarded baskets from which a number are
subsampled. From the subsampled baskets the length frequencies are taken
from all species but only those for cod, haddock, whiting and saithe are
subsequently stored electronically. 

The raw data we store (electronically) is therefore number of baskets
discarded, the number subsampled and the length frequencies of the cod,
haddock, whiting, and saithe that were subsampled. 

In the SL table for the discarded fraction ($catchCat = &quot;DIS&quot;) we have
weight ($wt) and subsampled weight ($subSampWt) and species ($spp) 

I can calculate a subsampled weight by species using the length
frequency distribution and a standard weight length relationship (for
each species) and use the raising factor of discarded baskets to
subsampled baskets to obtain a discarded weight by species. 
However this seems to me a long way from the raw data and also involves
the assumption that the raising factor from the baskets is the same for
all the fish species. 

Is that what we want to do?    

All the best
Alastair
