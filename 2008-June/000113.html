Alastair Pout a &#233;crit :

Hi All

I'm trying to get some FRS observer (discard) data into COST format and

have a query about fitting into the SL table format the subsampling of

the discarded catch. 

 

At the point at which we sample discards they are unsorted, and a

secondary problem is that the discarded and subsampled fraction are

measured in baskets rather than as an actual weight, though baskets have

a nominal weight. 

 

So specifically, our sampling protocol is that for each haul we have a

total number of unsorted discarded baskets from which a number are

subsampled. From the subsampled baskets the length frequencies are taken

from all species but only those for cod, haddock, whiting and saithe are

subsequently stored electronically. 

 

The raw data we store (electronically) is therefore number of baskets

discarded, the number subsampled and the length frequencies of the cod,

haddock, whiting, and saithe that were subsampled. 

 

In the SL table for the discarded fraction ($catchCat = &quot;DIS&quot;) we have

weight ($wt) and subsampled weight ($subSampWt) and species ($spp) 

 

I can calculate a subsampled weight by species using the length

frequency distribution and a standard weight length relationship (for

each species) and use the raising factor of discarded baskets to

subsampled baskets to obtain a discarded weight by species. 

However this seems to me a long way from the raw data and also involves

the assumption that the raising factor from the baskets is the same for

all the fish species. 

 

Is that what we want to do?    

 

All the best

Alastair

Dear Alastair,

from the different issues addressed in your mail, the easiest one to 
answer is about having the same raising factor for all fish in the 
sampled baskets : YES.

For the weight, my first question is how do you evaluate discards weight 
without information on weight? here we used to weight the sampled 
baskets (or sum of the weight of the species in the sampled baskets) and 
apply the raising factor (total no of baskets/ no sampled baskets). When 
the weighting is impossible or inaccurate (bad weather, ...) there is 
the possibility to use length~weight relationship provided that these 
parameters are estimated that very quarter in that very division. If 
this is not possible, then we use what we can (standard L~W 
relationship) but we try to update these standards one by one. Anyhow, 
the weight is a mandatory variable we cannot skip, that's why I have 
asked this question at the beginning of the paragraph!

Concerning the non storage of the other length structures, it's a pity! 
would there be a possibility to register this information by 
sub-contractors eventually?

Back to COST issues, I suppose there is no other ways for you than going 
through standard L~W relationships. Any other ideas?

Best regards

Joel

Hi Joel

 

Discard weight by species where the baskets are mixed is calculated 
retrospectively from the length frequency and a length weight 
relationship and then scaled with the raising factor.

How often our length weight relationships are updated I do not know, I 
suspect not that often! and entering all species into our database I 
agree would be desirable but it's a question of manpower and priorities 
I guess.

 

My only other thoughts were allowing $spp in Sl to be e.g. Gadidae sp. 
and in hl to be more precise, or recording sampled baskets and discarded 
baskets instead of weight in sl, but neither of these are viable.

So my concern was really whether these sorts of manipulations to get a 
weight had implications for bootstrapping and or precision estimates.     

 

All the best

Alastair
