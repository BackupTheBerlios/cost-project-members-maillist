</I>&gt;<i> Sent: 28 May 2008 11:57
</I>&gt;<i> To: cost member
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Cost-project-members] size categories
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can anyone clarify this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Scotland (and probably other countries as well) the size category is
</I>&gt;<i> not nationally defined, instead it is something determined by the
</I>&gt;<i> individual boats. So there could be anything up to 6 size categories on
</I>&gt;<i> any one boat, and size 3 say would not be the same as on any other boat.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This means that when length samples are taken it is necessary to record
</I>&gt;<i> the number of fish in the size category from which they are taken. This
</I>&gt;<i> usually means one box is taken for length  measurements, and  the number
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> of boxes of that size class on the boat is recorded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I can't see how this will be recorded in the COST format. In
</I>&gt;<i> the SL record there are weight and subsample weight fields, but the
</I>&gt;<i> comments to the weight field say that for market sampling the &quot;catch
</I>&gt;<i> weight is per definition equal to sample weight&quot;. What does this mean,
</I>&gt;<i> and how will the size category weight be recorded?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, it would be really nice if  there was some more data available.
</I>&gt;<i> Particularly data including discards would be helpful. There isn't any
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment as far as I can tell.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi David
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes in the Scottish demersal fleet size classes are quite arbitrary and
</I>&gt;<i> not standard between vessels. So they will usually be something like
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;whole&quot; then &quot;small&quot; &quot;medium&quot; and &quot;large&quot; gutted. But what constitutes a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;large&quot; fish for example is dependant on the trip, vessel, species, time
</I>&gt;<i> of year etc etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In our market sampling procedure one box will be taken from each size
</I>&gt;<i> class and the lengths taken from all the fish in that box. Also the
</I>&gt;<i> weight of that box.
</I>&gt;<i> Landed weight for that size class is number of boxes landed x sampled
</I>&gt;<i> box weight.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In COST format I have translated this as, in the sl table, weight ($wt)
</I>&gt;<i> is my total landed weight for the size class and subsample weight
</I>&gt;<i> ($subSampWt) the weight of the sampled box. Commercial size category
</I>&gt;<i> ($commCat) is 1, 2,3, .. depending on the number of size classes.
</I>&gt;<i> But a 1 for one trip is not necessarily the same as a 1 for another
</I>&gt;<i> trip.
</I>&gt;<i> And (obviously) each tr - hh record has as many sl records as there were
</I>&gt;<i> commercial size classes landed. Total landed weight for the species on
</I>&gt;<i> the trip is the sum of $wt over the sl tables.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree &quot;For Market sampling: Catch weight is per definition equal to
</I>&gt;<i> Sample weight&quot; does not make any sense in our context.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the best
</I>&gt;<i> Alastair

Dear all,

per definition, size category sampling means that the characteristics 
of the sorting is similar for all the trips, and the sampling unit is a 
size category. Of course, the degree of similarity varies from one trip 
to another, etc... but the most important is that the size grades seen 
on board (CS tables) can be raised to the overall weight of the same 
size grades estimated from the landings statistics (CL table).

When it is not the case (as is the Scottish case), the sampling 
strategy becomes a m&#233;tier sampling, i.e. the sampling unit is a Fishing 
Operation or a Fishing trip. The size category is a mean to organise 
the sub-sampling and help the sampler to be more precise and accurate. 
In this case, the information estimated from the landings statistics is 
the weight landed for that m&#233;tier (combination of gear, target species, 
area and time). The information in HL is the number of fish really 
measured, corresponding to SubSample weight in SL. The raising factor 
is SL$Weight/SL$Subsample weight.

Concerning the comment &quot;For market sampling: Catch weight is per 
definition equal to Sample weight.&quot;. I understand it's confusing, as 
there is the possibility to subsample in the case of m&#233;tier sampling. 
Maybe Teunis could give us his thoughts about this. I would think it's 
just a problem of label.

In all cases, summing over the HL$No at length should always give us 
the number of fish sampled.

I also reiterate my demand to get more datasets available from ALL the 
institutes involved in COST. this is becoming URGENT and must be given 
highest priority.

Best regards

Joel
