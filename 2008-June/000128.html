</I>&gt;<i>     formodifications
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     prior to the meeting and summarising the latest discussions in the
</I>&gt;<i>     mailing list, in the forum and in multilateral correspondance,
</I>&gt;<i>     here are the issues to be discussed regarding the COST-FF Data
</I>&gt;<i>     Exchange Format :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     * the major discussion is about the sex field in hl table. The
</I>&gt;<i>     issue is about extending this concept to other possibilities than
</I>&gt;<i>     F/M and also extending the concept to take into consideration the
</I>&gt;<i>     taxa in a sampled box.
</I>&gt;<i>     The system today is that a given hh$staNum or hh$trpCode is
</I>&gt;<i>     documented with sl$spp related to cl$spp and ce$spp at the
</I>&gt;<i>     population level. for this sl$spp we may have different sexes
</I>&gt;<i>     (case of Nephrops) registered in hl$sex.
</I>&gt;<i>     The first problem is that we don't have the sampled weight per
</I>&gt;<i>     sex. It's not a problem to estimate the total number and the total
</I>&gt;<i>     length structure per sex, but how do we calculate the total weight
</I>&gt;<i>     per sex?
</I>&gt;<i>     The second point is about burried Nephrops. I must say I don't see
</I>&gt;<i>     where is the problem here. The field is optional for unsexed and,
</I>&gt;<i>     unless I miss something, you cannot sex the burried Nephrops? Do
</I>&gt;<i>     we open this field to other occurences? B(urried), ...
</I>&gt;<i>     The third point is about extending the concept of sex to taxa
</I>&gt;<i>     because for me it is the same issue for raising. Some sl$spp
</I>&gt;<i>     (Anglerfish, squids, ...) are a mixture of different species in
</I>&gt;<i>     the sampled box. The raising must be done at the level of
</I>&gt;<i>     taxon/sex, although we only have spp info in cl and ce. If we
</I>&gt;<i>     extend the concept of sex to a field called taxon which would
</I>&gt;<i>     include the sex, it can be a way out to this. This field would be
</I>&gt;<i>     optional in case of similarity with hl$spp.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     * including survey data in COST, and in particular DATRAS data. We
</I>&gt;<i>     only need this information for stock-related variables (sex-ratio,
</I>&gt;<i>     maturity, individual weight, age-at-length). The principle agreed
</I>&gt;<i>     at the beginning of the project is that the ca table would be
</I>&gt;<i>     attached to tr only , same as for the purchase of fish. In the ca
</I>&gt;<i>     table we made sure we had all the information needed like time
</I>&gt;<i>     strata (quarter, month) and space strata (area, rectangle). I
</I>&gt;<i>     understand that by doing so we do not include the DATRAS data as
</I>&gt;<i>     such in COST but COST is not meant to calculate survey indices.
</I>&gt;<i>     During this project we should stick to this, although there are ca
</I>&gt;<i>     fields that can be used to link ca to hh and/or sl if needed
</I>&gt;<i>     (staNum, sex, ...), but this should not be the rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     * some minor issues like
</I>&gt;<i>     - should vessel type (tr) be mandatory or optional. IMO what
</I>&gt;<i>     should be mandatory are the fields essential to the estimation of
</I>&gt;<i>     the variables and their precision. COST is not a database.
</I>&gt;<i>     Following this, vessel type should not be mandatory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - should gear (hh) corresponds only to the survey gear and not
</I>&gt;<i>     commercial where there are two metier fields (field 25 and 26).
</I>&gt;<i>     Only one of these fields is mandatory and it is the metier level 5
</I>&gt;<i>     (Gear + Target Assemblage). In the new DCR Regulation, the level 6
</I>&gt;<i>     is mandatory (Gear + Target Assemblage + Mesh size and selective
</I>&gt;<i>     device). Anyhow, it will take time before all the countries are
</I>&gt;<i>     able to document levle 6 for all their fisheries. The situation as
</I>&gt;<i>     it is now is a good compromise, level 5 is mandatory in cs, cl and
</I>&gt;<i>     ce. Implicitly, this means that you have to know the gear to
</I>&gt;<i>     document level 5 for your fisheries. I would change nothing here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - length corresponds only to total length. IMO it is not advisable
</I>&gt;<i>     to proceed to transformation of variable prior to use it in COST.
</I>&gt;<i>     I mean the length as it is measured will be used in age_length
</I>&gt;<i>     keys and we would find the same information both in hl and in ca.
</I>&gt;<i>     Tansforming to total length in both ca and hl would lead to errors
</I>&gt;<i>     and increase of uncertainty. The solution would be to add a field
</I>&gt;<i>     Length type to hl and ca to ensure that they are both compatible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Probably there are some other issues, so don't hesitate to mention
</I>&gt;<i>     them. You may react to my suggestions, especially the FF (not
</I>&gt;<i>     France Football) players! The outcome of this discussion and the
</I>&gt;<i>     agreements will be summarised in the report of the meeting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Best regards

</I>&gt;<i>     [David Maxwell (Cefas)]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Joel wrote &gt;&gt;* including survey data in COST, and in particular
</I>&gt;<i>     DATRAS data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Lisa has written some SAS code that converts data from the DATRAS
</I>&gt;<i>     output data file to the FF/Cost format. So even if this is not
</I>&gt;<i>     mandatory we can do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     There are several blank columns but it means that all CS tables
</I>&gt;<i>     are present, the CS input function works and length distributions
</I>&gt;<i>     can be linked to the biological data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Here are comments from the very recent workshop (WKMOG) that used
</I>&gt;<i>     the data format (and my thoughts)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Code lists (should be easy):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The field &#8220;otolith side&#8221; could include an option for when other
</I>&gt;<i>     calcified structures are used (i.e. illicia, spines&#8230;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The coding system used for rectangle and/or area for the
</I>&gt;<i>     Mediterranean countries would need to be incorporated (SAC-GFCM
</I>&gt;<i>     Geographical Sub-Areas in the Mediterranean (Rome, 2006)).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Extra field (not needed immediately, one for the future?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The biological samples (CA) table does not take account of
</I>&gt;<i>     histology results, these are necessary if a correction factor or
</I>&gt;<i>     calibration is required for the maturity stages. an extra,
</I>&gt;<i>     optional, field is necessary for the microscopic maturity stage
</I>&gt;<i>     results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Field description (easy)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Due to interpretation issues with the &#8216;length class&#8217; field and its
</I>&gt;<i>     corresponding field &#8216;length code&#8217;, it was decided that a fuller
</I>&gt;<i>     explanation was required, i.e. In mm, Actual length or lower bound
</I>&gt;<i>     of length class e.g. 650 for 65-66 cm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Extra field (already in topics to discuss)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     When survey data are used the species list (SL) table should
</I>&gt;<i>     include a field for sex. This is necessary as some species of fish
</I>&gt;<i>     are sexed prior to weighing, such as flat fish and elasmobranches.
</I>&gt;<i>     This extra field is necessary in order to raise maturity correctly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I will need to be very awake next week!

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dear All
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Clarifications on dealing with Nephrops:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Carapace lengths are used to estimate weight, and where only tails are 
</I>&gt;<i> available the width is measured and can be converted to an approximate 
</I>&gt;<i> length, thence weight.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The proportions of tails in a sample is both variable and can be quite 
</I>&gt;<i> high apparently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The issue seems to me that in terms of deriving precision estimates we 
</I>&gt;<i> need to be considering the precision of the measured variable, rather 
</I>&gt;<i> than a derived measure, therefore we are dealing with the lowest level 
</I>&gt;<i> of disaggregated data available therefore we need to include tail width.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It also seems to me that this is just another sorting process Nephrops 
</I>&gt;<i> have in effect been sorted into tails and wholes all we need to do is 
</I>&gt;<i> include &#8220;Nephrops&#8221; into $commCatScl (commercial size category scale) 
</I>&gt;<i> in the Sl table with &#8220;tail&#8221; and &#8220;whole&#8221; (or &#8220;carapace&#8221;) being added to 
</I>&gt;<i> the appropriate code list for $commCat
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Berried Nephrops (females with eggs) (apologies for the buried/berried 
</I>&gt;<i> confusion) as I understand it have different catchabilities in trawls 
</I>&gt;<i> and pots and form different proportions of the catch at different 
</I>&gt;<i> times of the year. Can this also not be very easily accommodated in 
</I>&gt;<i> the CA table with additions of &#8220;Nephrops&#8221; to the code list for 
</I>&gt;<i> $matScale (maturity scale) and &#8220;berried&#8221; and &#8220;not berried&#8221; in 
</I>&gt;<i> $matSatge (maturity stage)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the best
</I>&gt;<i>

Hi Alastair,

Your suggestion looks like a good solution and you are correct, tales 
and wholes are separated due to the very different commercial value, so 
it works like a stratification factor. I guess you have a similar 
problem with gutted and ungutted fish.

Best
