<PRE>Hi Ernesto, Joel, Mathieu and all.  

0.6 looks really good and the documentation is a big plus in seeing
everything you have been up to!
I'm happy to look at the English if you don't mind a bit of rewording
here and there.  

Just one thing about the cost core, setting up the non numerics as
factors might cause a few problems down the line. Had a quick look at
your code and I don't think they are used as factors anywhere, and (as I
am sure you know) there are a number of things about factors that might
not be desirable particularly for those not too familiar with R
1.	for virtually anything that needs to be done to manipulate data
all factors will need to be changed using as.character(xx) because
factors are stored as a list of character names (the levels of the
factor) and as numeric values and if not specified the numeric value is
used.  
2.	a unique set of levels for each factor is created with the
creation of each data frame, which will have to be delt with if data
frames are merged at any point. And there are little pitfalls like the
name of a variable being retained in the levels list even if the values
of a particular factor are all removed. 
3.	ordering of levels is alphabetic and so does not follow the
sequential ordering in a data frame, again this a potential trap that
has to be appreciated in any indexing tasks. 
4.	Down the line factors may need to be defined for modelling.  

Could I suggest we stick to characters and numerics for the two classes
for variables in the data sets?
