	Hi all, 
	
	A little question has raised while I was trying to implement a
&quot;Volume 
	of DIS/LAN per haul/trip&quot; plotting procedure. What is the
indicator in 
	CS tables that tells us if an FO has been sampled or not? 
	The fact that this FO is in SL table might be one, but it
implies that 
	SL is an exhaustive description of all sampled FOs in HH table. 
	The problem is that I'm working with a 'sole' dataset, so
sampled FOs 
	may not be exhaustively described in SL (zero-values not
recorded). 
	To my understanding ,the current situation requires that the
datasets 
	comprise all species to assess which FO has been sampled or not.

	Would it be better to add a field 'FO sampled' in HH table? 
	
	
	Best 
	Mathieu

	Dear Mathieu 
	This information is found in the &quot;sampling type&quot; field. The
sampling 
	type is the data collection protocol used. What you are after
is: 
	&quot;S&quot; = Sea sampling 
	versus 
	&quot;P&quot; = partial sea sampling 
	In the descriptions of the sampling types in the data exchange
format 
	doc; you can read that &quot;S&quot;-data has full species distribution
while &quot;P&quot; 
	only samples few specific species in the catch. So when SL data
are 
	present but without any sole-records, then you know it is a
0-catch when 
	sampling type is &quot;S&quot;. 
	Best regards 
	Teunis 

	

	Dear Teunis,
	
	I see your point concerning &quot;S&quot; and &quot;P&quot; which are very relevant
and refer to the sampling protocol applied to the sampled trip. For the
last call for data launched by STECF last year we have provided only &quot;S&quot;
information because the &quot;P&quot; is hardly workable. Nevertheless, your
statement only works if the non-sampled FOs are absent from the
database, which is not the case. The observers take the information from
every FOs on effort and location and even on the estimated weight of
every landed species. When raising by an auxiliary variable, you can
then easily raise to the trip
	
	When some information is given for all FOs the issue is about
discriminating 0-values from non-sampled FOs without having to address
the whole database. I explain: here in Ifremer, we have access to the
whole database (I guess it is the same in FF), so we count the sampled
FOs by looking at FOs where any species have been measured and we subset
for one particular species in a second step. By doing so, we don't have
any problems with 0-values, we make the sum and we divide by the total
number of sampled FO calculated before subsetting. For the variance, you
have to pay attention and include as many (0 - mean)^2 as necessary but
it works.
	
	For COST, do we want the user to provide the full dataset each
time one wants to raise discards or do we want to let the user provide
only a subset with one species? Do we want the user to remove all the
information recorded for the non-sampled FOs ? If we do so, how do we
count the total effort of the trip (hours, days) or the total landings
of that trip (landings of the targeted species, one particular species
or whole landings) for raising by an auxiliary variable? Moreover, the
DEF today allows to record any information we want on non-sampled FOs.
It would be a pity not to use it.
	
	The simple solution would be to add a field &quot;FO Sampled&quot; Y/N in
HH table.
	
	The fact that we have the information on the total number of FOs
in a trip in TR table allows to control if we have as many records in HH
and then raise by any auxiliary variable available. If not, it means
that most of the auxiliary variable are unavailable for raising.
	
	Best regards

	Hi All 

	Could fishing validity $foVal in the hh not be used for this
purpose? 

	I'm not sure what its present purpose is but we could define it
as any haul which contributes to effort but for which there are no
subsequent sl hl records. 

	All the best

	Alastair

	

	
	

Hi Alastair,

This is a very good point.

There could be 3 modalities for this field
I : Invalid
F : Full Validity (FO sampled)
P : Partial Validity  (FO not sampled) 

Best regards

Joel


 

 
Dear All 
(COST &amp; DIFRES dev. group)
 
Henrik and I have discussed this and we agree that there is a problem
when you have registered all information on a station except the catch.
If you have total catch in weight per species, then there is no problem
because then you just set SL.validityCode to 4.
 
So we agree to put in a new field on HH. It should not be called
&quot;Sampled&quot;, because then it might be confused with the SL.validityCode,
that tells us if the catch has been sampled for length distribution. We
suggest &quot;HH.CatchRegistration&quot;. Codes for this field could be: &quot;All
species&quot;, &quot;Subset of all species&quot; and &quot;No species&quot;.
 
The suggested solution of using the HH.FishingValidity violates database
design rules, because it is mixing of two different information in one
field. HH.FishingValidity is used when a haul is invalid an example
could be if the trawl is lost or so damaged, that the catch is not
representative.
 
We will send out an updated version of the exchange format document if
there is agreement on this solution. The update will also include the
reordering of key fields on CA (see another mailing-thread).
 
Best regards
Henrik and Teunis
