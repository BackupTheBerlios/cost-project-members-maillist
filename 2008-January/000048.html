<PRE>Dear colleagues,

we should have submitted the interim report to the Commission by 
mid-January but I have asked for one month delay in order to have more 
flesh to put on the bones. The new deadline is now 16th of February. The 
leaders of the different tasks may send me some text on what has been 
done so far and how they plan to finish their work. I know there are 
some pending issues linked to some late discussions on the DEF to &quot;let 
all the horses ride&quot; (French expression!) but I know also that there is 
lot of work done so far even if we don't see it yet on the CVS 
repository. It is time to make the point and write this report. The 
structure should be

*Section 1 : Project objectives and major achievements during the 
reporting period
*

    * Project objectives (Joel) &lt;- taken from the submission of the project
    * Outcome of the expert meeting (Joel) &lt;- sections On the Open
      Source philosophy, On the use of the developer Website, and
      Raising methods
    * The Data Exchange Format (Teunis and Henrik) &lt;- not much more to
      do than extracting the first 21 pages of the FF DEF + appendix and
      calling it the joint COST-FF DEF for example. We would need also a
      presentation section focusing on the modifications brought to the
      original FF DEF. I don't want to let think that we've just copied
      and paste! Concerning the appendix, we should refer to
      international database when exist rather than listing all possible
      occurences, ex. for the species list (ISCAAP) or the FAO
      codification for the areas and rectangles (valid for all the
      world) :
      <A HREF="http://fishnet.jrc.it/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=2502&amp;name=DLFE-261.xls">http://fishnet.jrc.it/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=2502&amp;name=DLFE-261.xls</A>).
    * Constitution of datasets (Mathieu) &lt;- and others if other datasets
      are available in the meantime (I would appreciate!)

*Section 2 -- Workpackage progress during the period
*

    * The Core package (Ernesto)  &lt;- Text based on the package doc
      provided but we would need some text of presentation ahead +
      version 1.0 would be fantastic.
    * The Exploratory Data analysis package (Mathieu and Alastair)  &lt;-
      sections on general presentation, on-board catch estimates, length
      and age structure, other biological parameters (work done and
      planned based on the expert meeting) + as many graphs and examples
      of use as possible
    * The Design-Based package (David M.) &lt;- same as for the EDA but
      with more focus on the planned programme
    * The Model-Based package (David H.) &lt;- id.
    * The simulation package (waiting or the 2nd expert meeting)

*Section 3 -- Consortium management (Joel)
*

    * Expert meeting, agenda, difficulties encountered and other
      administrative stuff...



Concerning the _*next COST meeting*_, we stopped the discussion in 
November. We have to wake it up and finalise dates and location now. 
When we stopped the discussion AZTI agreed to host but was hesitating 
between 2 locations. there was also a problem for the dates knowing that 
there was several meeting in June. WKACCU involving COST members was 
moved to October and David Maxwell let me know that the WKMOG (2 to 6 
June, Lisbon) was to use the COST functions and would probably involve 
some COST experts and that we would consider binding WKMOG and COST 
meeting to avoid emitting to much carbon by plane travelling! I totally 
agree with the idea and I suggest to hold the COST meeting the week 
immediatly after WKMOG (9 - 12 June). The problem is that there is a 
meeting WKSC (Workshop on Fishers Sampling of Catches) in Copenhagen 
that same week.

The question is : who is expected to attend both COST and WKSC meeting 
and would be bothered if they were meeting simultaneously?

Thank you for your attention

Best regards

Joel
