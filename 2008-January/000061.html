<PRE>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Dear All
	New version &quot;25 January 2008&quot; attached.
	No structural changes in format, only in descriptions and code 
reference lists:
	 1. I agree that AS and CC has not been discussed in the COST forum. I 
suppose that this is likely to happen in a future COST 2. So we will 
keep the FishFrame-only formats in a separate document until then.
	 2. I agree in all Joel's suggestions of links to FAO-codes lists and 
have added the link to the country code list as well. The links instead 
of the full lists makes appendix 1 more reader friendly (it can now be 
printed out without having to cut down a forest each time).
	 3. Some code lists like &quot;FAC national&quot;, &quot;Commercial Size Category 
Scale&quot;, &quot;Project&quot; are open for additions. This is noted in appendix 1.
	 4. Due to the removal of SL.ValidityCode some comments should be 
changed/deleted:
	      4.1 Comment 1 under SL: Text changed from &quot;Mandatory if 
validitycode = 1&quot; to &quot;Mandatory if child HL records exist&quot;.
	      4.2 Comment 1 under HL:  Text removed: &quot;HLs are not allowed is 
the parent SL record has ValidityCode = 4.&quot;
	 5. Does anybody know a good official link for the list of statistical 
rectangles? ICES only seem to have a shape-file. So the full list of 
rectangles is still in appendix 1.
	 6. Addition to the description of the sex-fields on HL and CA: 
&quot;(Optional for &quot;Unsexed&quot;)&quot;.
	Note that there will be two meetings for reviewing the &quot;Fisheries 
Activity Category European&quot; matrix soon, this will most likely result 
in modifications of lvl 6 and possibly 5. Hopefully this will fix these 
codes for a while. BTW: We should consider having both the minimum and 
maximum mesh size as part of the code - but lets save the discussion 
until after the meetings.
	I suggest that all structural changes from now on are logged in an 
appendix 3. It is our experience from many exchange format changes in 
FishFrame 1 to 4, that the users responsible for the data extraction 
and formatting scripts find this very useful.
	Best regards
	Teunis
