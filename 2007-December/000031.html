<PRE>Dear COST members,

after 6 months of development, the COST project has recently entered a 
new phase where all developers are in a position to create their 
functions and share their development. I want here to recall the need 
to use the mailing list to discuss the algorithms and put the functions 
created on the CVS repository in order to have feedback from all other 
members.

Up to now, we have managed to fix a data exchange format and release a 
beta version of COSTcore. The experts working on the EDA package have 
progressed and some others have begun to work on their algorithms.

 From the beginning of next year, we'll need all developers on the deck 
and all COST members ready to participate to the discussions. The 
success of COST will depend on our ability to do the maximum of work 
during the first 3/4 months of 2008. During this period, I will have to 
elaborate an interim document summarising all the work done so far and 
the planned programme to end the project. This document will authorise 
the Commission to finance another 40% of the project.

I'll come back to you in the beginning of next year for more precision.

I would like to thank all the experts having given their energy so far 
to the progress of this project and I wish you all very happy Chrismas 
holidays.

Best regards

Joel
