<PRE>Hi Joel, Mathieu and ALL 

 

I'm down to be going to this WKACCU too, and was planning to work through as much of the ToRs as possible using the COSTeda package on some Scottish data. Certainly ....

 

c)       Each participant should prepare geographical distribution charts to the workshop of the national catches shown on a map including the same geographical cells/strata that are the basis for the geographical collection of biological stock data.

d)       On the same map, or on a copy of the map, suitable information about the coverage of the samples should be presented- with the aim of ensuring that all areas with catches are sampled. Percentages of catches up against samples could be presented on this geographical cells/strata basis.

 

.... should be easy enough to do with &quot;spacePlot&quot;. 

So hopefully that will kill two birds with one stone. 

 

 

P.S. not sure what the latest version of COSTeda is but when you are ready for a new release let me know and I'll send the latest version of my stuff.  

 

All the best

Alastair

Dear colleagues,

there will be a workshop very soon where the COST developments could be helpful :

Workshop on Methods to evaluate and estimate the accuracy of fisheries data used for assessment [WKACCU] 
(Co-Chairs: Michael Pennington* and Jon Helge V&#248;lstad*, IMR, Norway (will be established and will meet in Bergen, Norway, 27-30 October 2008 to 

1.      review the sources of bias and establish general parameters (indicators)/procedures to assess the bias on national level of fishery statistics (quantities landed, discards, fishing effort, CPUE) using available data, and advice on best practices. 

2.      review the sources of bias and establish general parameters (indicators)/procedures to assess the bias on national level of biological data collected from the fisheries by investigating (both visual and quantitative) the data coverage by stock, area, season and fleet


In that view, I would like to prepare a &quot;COST&quot; Working Document explaining what we have developed in relation to the estimates of bias, i.e. all graphs in EDA package. It would be relevant also to intiate a discussion, both for the COST final report and for the WKACU, on the bias : definition, measure and understandings of the graphical outcomes.

I demand Alastair and Mathieu to prepare a document showing all graphs available in the EDA package. I will launch a discussion later on the points cited above. In the meantime, don't hesitate to comment and make suggestions on this issue.

Best regards

Joel
