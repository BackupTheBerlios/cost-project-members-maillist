<PRE>Dear COST members,

I haven't received much concerning the progress of work since my last 
message and the CVS folders remain desperately unchanged. I know the 
schedules are tight and the workload outside COST world is heavy but we 
need now to finalise the packages and propose ALL methods developed so 
far on the website. Deadline for this : 31st of October.

Concerning the deadline of the project, it is my intention to postpone 
the delivering of the final report to the end of March 2009. Don't take 
this as an argument not to respect the deadline above! There will be no 
development of new methods in 2009, only appropriation of codes, 
beta-testing and writing of manuals, examples and final report.

I have asked the European Commission about the continuation of COST and 
the need to have training courses for all Member States in 2009. I'll 
let you know as soon as I have proposals on this.

I recall that we have received the 2nd budget from the EC. Some of you 
need to send an invoice, they should do so as soon as possible. For the 
others, the payment will be effective in the coming weeks.

There is still some money available in some institutes for travelling. 
I recall that the final payment will reimburse the travel expenses only 
based on evidences. Can you tell me who still has money to travel, so 
that it is possible to convene a last meeting (in an institute having 
spent all its money) around mid- December.

Please, make an effort to submit all of your code in the CVS folders 
before the end of October. Mathieu and I will be in Bergen next week 
attending the workshop on accuracy, but we will be glad to answer your 
questions.

Best regards

Joel
