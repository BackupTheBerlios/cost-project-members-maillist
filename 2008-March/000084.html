<PRE>Dear all,

the result of the poll has shown that no week in June could gather all 
the leaders of the tasks. Moreover, I don't want to postpone this 
meeting further because of summer holidays and I don't want to make it 
earlier because of the amount of work to do before the meeting.

The dates where most of the leaders are available are 24 - 26 June, as 
all the leaders of tasks 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will be present.

*The meeting will be held in the premises of AZTI *(exact location to be 
defined)* from 24 June 9:00 to 26 June 18:00*

This means that we'll have to work without Ernesto who was the most 
active in the project until now. If we want that meeting to be 
efficient, we have to work very hard until the meeting to finish task 3 
and develop as much as possible tasks 4 and 5.

Here is a planned agenda

   1. *It is urgent that all experts involved in the project export
      datasets of their own in the FishFrame/COST echange forma*t and
      make these datasets available for the developers. We're still
      working on one only dataset.
   2. On their own datasets, I would like the COST experts to use all
      the functions available and beta-test the functions from now on.
   3. In the very beginning of April, there must be a COSTeda package
      version 0.1 available on the web site.
   4. There was a discussion ongoing on the raising procedures that I
      have to resume in the coming days.
   5. The leaders of tasks 4 and 5 must release their first functions in
      the CVS repository at the latest in the beginning of May (for beta
      testing)

Another important point is that the COST expert meeting is opened to all 
COST members, not only the leaders of the tasks.

Thank you for your contibution

Best regards

Joel
