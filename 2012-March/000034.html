<PRE>character variables haveing a list of character stings for permissible
variables and all numerics being either real or integer and haveing a
specified range.=20





I have the &quot;check.fileds&quot; function more or less ready, and this can now
save its output to file.=20
Also (so that nobody else spends time doing this)  I have created list
objects for all the variables in the fish frame tables ce cl and the cs.
For characters (factors) this is Teunis's  &quot;code lists&quot;, and for
numerics it's the permissible ranges.=20

e.g.
names(code.list)
 [1] &quot;landCtry&quot;   &quot;vslFlgCtry&quot; &quot;area&quot;       &quot;rect&quot;       &quot;foCatNat&quot; =20
 [6] &quot;foCatEu5&quot;   &quot;foCatEu6&quot;   &quot;spp&quot;        &quot;landCat&quot;    &quot;commCatScl&quot;
[11] &quot;sampType&quot;   &quot;proj&quot;       &quot;sampCtry&quot;   &quot;sampMeth&quot;   &quot;foVal&quot;    =20
[16] &quot;aggLev&quot;     &quot;date&quot;       &quot;time&quot;       &quot;catchCat&quot;   &quot;subSampCat&quot;
[21] &quot;lenCode&quot;    &quot;sex&quot;        &quot;stock&quot;      &quot;plusGrp&quot;    &quot;otoSide&quot;  =20
[26] &quot;matScale&quot;   &quot;gear&quot;       &quot;valCode&quot;  =20

head(code.list$spp)

                species   tsn       nodc ices
1  Aphanothece saxicola   643 0302010405  001
2  Aphanothece stagnina   644 0302010406  002
3      Asarum hartwegii 18356 3206010205  003
4         Nuphar luteum 18372 3207010301  004
5      Penstemon dolius 33885 3270035536  005
6 Penstemon linarioides 33937 3270035570  006


This potentially allows us to validate any data against this and there
is the potential to add to the code lists if we feel in time that COST
needs to include more than is currently allowed by fish frame.=20

Also have made data frame lifted from the FF document which is just all
the variables, the info on them and indicator variables for which tables
they occur in. =20
e.g.=20

    variable           description type cetab cltab trtab hhtab sltab
hltab catab req    checks
1 vslFlgCtry Vessel Flag Country *    s     1     1     1     1     1
1     1   M Code list
                                                  Comments
ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes. The flag country of the vessel


The problem I will have is getting this all onto the CVS site! Might
need some help there.=20

#---------------------------------

For the raw data - validated data stage=20
Don't know what anybody else thinks but seems to me all we need to do is
Read in (or create) data in R in FF exchange format =3D ceData-class
clData-calss

Run the various validation functions=20

Ernesto's check methods
checkCLmns
	check

My check fields=20

Mathieu's outlier identifier

And if all those are passed OK then the data is class validated =20

If we wanted to keep things tight we could have it that these functions
returned data passed to them that was ok and didn't otherwise.=20

It might be a bit late to suggest it now but the simplest way to record
the validation status is to have a slot called &quot;status&quot; on the ce, cl
and cs data (or used description) which is set at either &quot;raw&quot; or
&quot;validated&quot;. It would be raw while the validation functions are running
and validated when these checks are successful. Then any function can
have a line at the beginning which checks=20

if(<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/cost-project-members">costobj at status</A>=3D=3D&quot;raw&quot; )=20
{&quot;warning this is not validated&quot;...  and we may or may not allow the
function to run}=20

if(<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/cost-project-members">costobj at status</A>=3D=3D&quot;validated&quot; )=20
{
Does whatever the function does=20
}



All the best
Alastair=20

Subject: [Cost-project-members] COSTcore 0.6-0 is out !

Hi,

I've just uploaded to our file repository COSTcore 0.6-0
(<A HREF="https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3D7299">https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3D7299</A>) for
linux and R 2.6.1. Please Mathieu can you compile for windows and send
it to me !? Also the CVS repository is updated with this version.

This is the first version to pass R check (try R CMD check COSTcore).
The news file is attached.
     - It has all the man pages, although still in draft;
     - the data.frame columns of the several classes are now check and
set up properly;
     - validity for VAL classes is inherited from RAW classes;
     - is.* methods were removed, in S4 one should use the method &quot;is&quot;
to
check for an object class.

Please Mathieu, take a look at the data files and check that the sole
dataset is correct. Also please check the man pages regarding these
datasets and correct whatever you consider necessary.

I'd like one of our English speaking colleagues to take a look at the
man pages (attached is the pdf).

Now I need your feedback from you to correct bugs and/or implement
missing features. Whenever we feel COSTcore is stable we may release
version 1.

Best

EJ
