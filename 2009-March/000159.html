<PRE>Dear all,

last week in Ifremer, we had a working sesion with all responsibles for 
market sampling. 18 stocks were reviewed with the COST tools with people 
having very heterogeneous skills in R.

The programme to follow was

    * STEP 1 : Importation of data
          o Importation of samples from Ifremer central database
          o Importation of landings files
          o Importation of biological parameters
    * STEP 2 : Exploratory Data Analysis
          o Looking for errors : Delta plots
          o Reporting
          o Validation of the dataset
    * STEP 3 : Stratification and recoding
          o specification of the stratification
          o Spatial exploration
          o Recoding the strata (if necessary)
          o Consolidation of the dataset
          o Save/load the consolidated dataset
    * STEP 4 : Length Structure Analysis
          o Creation of the empty dbe object
          o Raising the data
          o Calculation of CI and CV
          o Graph the results
    * STEP 5 : Age structure Analysis
          o Exploratory analysis of the ALKs
          o Filling of the gaps, if needed
          o Combination of length structure and ALK to form Age structure
          o Calculation of CI and CV
          o Graph the results
    * STEP 6 : Analysis of biological parameters
          o Exploratory analysis
          o Calculation of the parameters
          o Graph the results

The workshop was very successful in the sense that the 18 stocks 
performed the analysis up to step 5. YES! The step 6 was performed only 
by a few stocks because of lack of time (3 days meeting). The results of 
the length structure perfectly match the length structure given by our 
central software, except some cases which are under scrutiny now. We 
have not looked yet at the age structures.

The strategies were all LS + ALK = AS (for stocks with age info, of course)
There were some stocks with size increments of 1 mm (Nephrops), 5 mm 
(sardine) and 1 cm
There were stocks with male and female mixed in the sampled boxes 
(Nephrops and megrim)
There were stocks with different species mixed in the sampled boxes 
(Lophius sp.)

The biggest issue was the importation phase. The error messages are 
difficult to interpret for a non expert. Once the datasets in the COST R 
environment, the level of stress goes down quickly :)

Otherwise, we have a problem of code in the raise length method, since 
it is very penalised by the size of the samples (we had a 1000 samples 
stock!!). It is a 6 dimensional object on which we use tapply and apply. 
I do not imagine performing a bootstrap on this!! Mathieu is looking at 
optimizing it.
The spatial plots did not work. It must be a minor issue, but we did not 
have time to fix it, plus the fact that for market sampling, we have not 
that much info to plot spatially.
The ALK views and gaps filling were much appreciated. In case of 
changing the size increment, there is a relevant demand to also specify 
the starting point so that all years/data could be comparable. In case 
of changing the increment, the length measurements in HL must also 
change accordingly, or the length structure estimated in the dbe object 
(I personnally prefer the latter). In both cases, Mathieu has to work 
out the code.
The bp estimates seem to work but they would deserve a special session.
We need a method to sum the strata of the dbe object in order to 
estimate yearly, or m&#233;tier or whatever combination of strata estimates 
with CV and CI. Mathieu will care of this.
We need a method to export the dbe object in InterCatch standard. Who 
takes care of this?

6 weeks from the deadline of the project, I must admit I was quite happy 
with these results. I think we are very close from a DBE package and 
we'll need to perform this kind of beta-testing session in other 
institutes, including direct age structure estimates, bootstrap, 
biological parameters and discards raising. We have one person testing 
the discards raising procedures full-time here on the Ifremer datasets 
and it seems to work correctly.

I'm a bit blind on what's going on for the MBE package, and also I would 
like some news from Dorleta on how we can proceed at best for the SIM 
package.

For all the codes that has been tested, we need the developers to fill 
completely and properly the help pages, then we'll consider a user 
manual following the step approach drafted above, (plus discards, plus 
mbe, plus sim, plus ...). I will circulate a report frame among the 
leaders of packages very soon.

I anticipate a demand for examples going through the whole process. I 
will draft some properly and tell you when I put them on the website.

Best regards

Joel
