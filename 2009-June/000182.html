<PRE>Dear all,

A project like COST can hardly be defined as ended, and actually it is  
not, but at some point I have to blow the final whistle, and declare  
the project ended.

What happened during the last weeks?
After we sent the final report to the Commission, an evaluation  
process began, both inside and outside the Commission. I received some  
information from an external reviewer telling me to relax as he  
appreciated very much the work we have done. The inside reviewing  
takes more time, and the Commission required from me the authorisation  
to delay by one month their final statement on the project. I accepted  
and we should receive the Commission's point of view by the end of June.

In the meantime, all the issues pointed out when drafting the final  
report have been addressed and even more... The website  
<A HREF="http://wwz.ifremer.fr/cost">http://wwz.ifremer.fr/cost</A> is updated with the most recent  
information, libraries, examples and user manual.

What's next on the agenda?
COSTsim will have some work done during the week, especially for the  
inclusion of COSTmbe methods in the tests. A new version of the  
library should be made available in the coming days.

In my lab, I had the opportunity to have a 2 month work by a student,  
and I asked him to develop a reporting method (to build upon disInfo).  
This method will cover four signatures
  - Validated objects and stratification : complete set of redesigned  
disInfo outputs presented in a pdf file
  - Consolidated objects : same as above
  - dbeObject : presentation of the length, age, cv in a pdf file
  - R analysis script : interpretation of the script for the creation  
of a pdf document (#comments become text, lines of commands are shown  
and interpeted).
This is expected to be available in August. It's a kind of free extra :)

We have to prepare the ICES WKPRECISE, and Dorleta will prepare  
something based on COSTsim. Thanks to her for this. I also demand you  
to test the libraries in preparation of this important meeting, which  
will define the reference precision indicators to be used in the Data  
Collection Framework.

The external reviewer told me he insisted in his review on the need to  
have a maintenance of the libraries in order to fix the bugs and  
provide some help to the users. It is my plan to enter into discussion  
on this issue with the Commission, once the project is accepted for  
final payment (I cross my fingers). I'll come back to you when  
preparing a proposal for a corrective and evolutive maintenance of COST.

To finish this message, I want to warmly thank all the developers and  
active members for the quality of your work and your dedication to the  
success of the project. I can say that we did spend much more time and  
energy than anticipated by the price given by the Commission, I guess  
that we'll be paid back, by the services that COST will provide to all  
of us. For example, the future development of our Ifremer database  
includes the full use of COST, and I guess we are not alone in this  
case.

Thanks again for your personal involvements.

All the best

Joel
