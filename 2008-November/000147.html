<PRE>Dear Teunis, Henrik, Lisa, Joel, Mathieu, Ernesto and All 

 

Nit picky things about the $foCatEu5 Nantes (DCR) matrix level 5 codes
.....

 

1. Can we set up an accepted protocol for the combination of level 4 and
level 5 codes 

These have the form XXX_YYY which is fine when the codes have 3 letters.


With the 2 letter codes e.g. purse seine PS there are a number of
possibilities. 

 

*	this becomes PS_ and so there would be for example PS__SPF for
purse seine small pelagic fish, a double underscore but still 7
characters long.  

 

*	this stays as PS and there would be PS_SPF but this is only 6
characters 

 

*	this is PS_SPF_ which is what is in the COSTcore code list at
the moment because PS_SPF_0_0_0 etc is currently in the FISHFRAME code
list as a level 6 and level 5's are defined as the first 7 characters
from the level 6's, which gives PS_SPF_ 

 

My preference would be to standardise on the PS__SPF form, 

This I think is much less problematical for manipulating when
programming as it means that all level 5 codes are 7 characters and
allows the gear and target assemblage to be split (e.g. using the R
functions substr or strsplit without having to worry that you get &quot;PF_&quot;
as a target assemblage). 

 

What does anybody else think?  

 

 

2. Gear codes: Are we all happy that the gear codes can be any from 

 

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.fao.org/FI/DOCUMENT/cwp/handbook/annex/AnnexM1fishinggear.pdf">ftp://ftp.fao.org/FI/DOCUMENT/cwp/handbook/annex/AnnexM1fishinggear.pdf</A>

 

and thus level 5 codes (&amp; level 6 codes)  can be made form these? 

 

Or are we adding level 5 (and level 6) codes to the Nantes matrix in
doing this?  

 

e.g. there is no OT code in the level 6's in the 26 feb 2008 def
document but is OT_MPD (or OT__MPD or OT_MPT_) a valid Nantes matrix
level 5 code? 

 

Seems to me it should be but I think we run the risk of proliferating
the number of possible metiers.   

 

And the other thing is that $gear is no longer in the FISHFRAME/COST
data exchange format. 

Attached is the list of codes we have at FRS for the Nantes matrix but
nobody here seems to know if this is definitive.  

 

3. And for reference, in the FISHFRAME 5.0 COST data exchange format
document in the 26 Feb 2008 version, as Mathieu noticed the other day,
some of the descriptions are wrong in the level 6's, which is what was
used for the current code list in COSTcore

 

e.g. page 43 

 

FPO_CRU  - Crustaceans bottom otter trawl 

 

FYK_CRU  - Crustaceans bottom otter trawl

 

FYK_MPD - mixed pelagic and demersal fish - bottom otter trawl 

 

These should be pots and fyke nets and I will correct these in the
COSTcore code.list 

 

All the best

Alastair
