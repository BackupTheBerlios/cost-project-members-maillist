<PRE>Dear COST members,

A new list has been created today for helping all COST users to  
inter-exchange their experiences and post their difficulties in using  
our packages. you may subscribe to this list by filling the relevant  
fields in page :
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/cost-project-users">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/cost-project-users</A>

Please communicate the existence of this list to all users you know  
around you.

This is not exactly a help-list since we have no budget allocated to  
answering such a list. The debugging that the developers will be able  
to do in such a list, will only be on a voluntary basis.


The final COST budget has still not been provided by the EC. This is  
the no news! Anyhow, I know some of you would have suffered some  
difficulties in receiving a budget so late after the closure of their  
budget. You'll all then receive your share (hopefully) in the  
beginning of next year.

After such a stressed year, let me wish you very nice Christmas  
holidays and all the best for the new year to come.

Joel
