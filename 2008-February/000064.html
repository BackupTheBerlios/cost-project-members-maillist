</I>&gt;<i> Dear David,
</I>&gt;<i> I have put the following on the discussion forum for 
</I>&gt;<i> COST but I don't know if it is read by the relevant 
</I>&gt;<i> persons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dear all (statisticians),
</I>&gt;<i> I am working with the design specification of some new 
</I>&gt;<i> versions of the raising procedure in FishFrame and have 
</I>&gt;<i> a problem which I believe is relevant for COST as well. I 
</I>&gt;<i> am talking about raising (species dist. and length dist.) 
</I>&gt;<i> from sample level to total landings. The raising is 
</I>&gt;<i> stratified on: country, Year, quarter, metier, area (and 
</I>&gt;<i> species). The samples are assumed to random samples 
</I>&gt;<i> of the landings and there is full record of all landings. 
</I>&gt;<i> My problem is if it is correct to apply some measures for 
</I>&gt;<i> the catch amount (not sample size) connected to the 
</I>&gt;<i> sample as weighting factor (e.g. the catch weight or 
</I>&gt;<i> effort depending of raising method). I have briefly 
</I>&gt;<i> discussed the issue with Joel and he strongly 
</I>&gt;<i> recommended that no weighting was introduced. I can 
</I>&gt;<i> see the point if we were estimating the species 
</I>&gt;<i> distribution in the underlying population (in the stock. 
</I>&gt;<i> In that case the catch itself is a sub-sample), but I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> understand why it is correct when we want to estimate 
</I>&gt;<i> the distribution in the landings (which has an 
</I>&gt;<i> underlying distribution of landing amounts). In my logic 
</I>&gt;<i> a weighting with the catch amount is the same as to 
</I>&gt;<i> estimate the species dist/length dist. in each landing 
</I>&gt;<i> and then sum all landings for a given metier (stratum).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would be very happy if I could get an advice what to 
</I>&gt;<i> do.
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you in advance,
</I>&gt;<i> Henrik

</I>&gt;<i> Hello Henrik,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am replying to the COST mailing list because the discussion forum is not being used.
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly the same question needs to be answered in COST so I hope there are more replies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For length distribution of commercial landings the traditional approach at Cefas is to use vessel raising. This is a weighted sum of samples as you described.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With weighting the questionable assumption is that a sample from a large landing gives more information than a sample from a small landing.
</I>&gt;<i> But the advantage is that if you sample all the landings then weighting will give the observed total and I don't think this is true if an unweighted average is raised to the stratum total landings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looking at Joel's formulae for D_j in the working document included as part of the COST project Appendix may help this discussion.

</I>This is my reply sent to Henrik yesterday:

You want an estimate of landings-at-length, and you have samples 
randomly taken from some sampling units (probably trips) for which you 
also have a measure of effort. The question is how to combine the 
samples, and in particular whether you should weight them by the effort.

The correct answer is that it depends on how dependent on the trip size 
the proportion at length is. There are basically two possible 
estimators: One is the mean of the sample proportions, the other is the 
weighted mean. The weighted mean always has a higher variance than the 
unweighted mean, but it is unbiased, so which is the best depends on how 
strong the dependence is (this will increase the bias of the unweighted 
estimator), and how different the weights are (this will increase the 
variance of the weighted estimator). If you have  enough samples you 
could do some bootstrapping to test this.

This is exactly the same problem we get when raising age samples to get 
landings-at-age. Different countries have different approaches. We have 
done some analysis of the problem for the Norwegian catch, and have 
found no effect of trip size, and so we use something similar to the 
unweighted estimate (we have a modelling approach, which is more 
complicated but allows us to do many things such as estimate missing 
strata, include sample size differences etc). I think the reason for 
this is that the stratification takes out most of the differences both 
in trip size and in proportions at length, so what is left is mostly 
random rather than systematic. The only exception we have found is in 
small coastal fisheries where the metier stratification doesn't really 
describe the differences in fishing patterns within the strata.
