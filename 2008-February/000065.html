<PRE>Henrik suggested this discussion should be continued on the COST mailing 
list (this was his reply to my reply). See bottom of message.

</I>&gt;<i> Am I right, if I conclude that the theoretically statistical correct and

</I>&gt;<i> how successful the stratification is concerning dissolving the trends in
</I>&gt;<i> the data. 
</I>&gt;<i> If this issue is to be discussed further, I suggest that it is done by
</I>&gt;<i> the COST mailing list because it seems to have general interest.

</I>&gt;<i> Thank you,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>There are two points here. The first is that the only genuinely unbiased 
estimator (at least for proportion of landings at length) would be the 
one weighted by the number (not the weight) of landings (not catch) in 
each trip. Using weight of landings in each trip would certainly not be 
unbiased, because bigger fish weigh more, and so you would be 
overestimating the number of large fish. It's difficult to say what the 
effect of using effort would be.

The second point is that the variance of the estimator is just as 
important as the bias. What you want is an estimate of the total that is 
as close to the true value as you can get. If the variance of your 
estimator is high, you will be no closer than if the bias is high. The 
only difference with bias is that in the long run, if you make enough 
estimates, an unbiased estimator will give you as many estimates that 
are too big as it will give estimates that are too small (roughly 
speaking). This is of no real value because you are interested in the 
individual estimate, not some long term properties of all your estimates 
combined. A good criterion to choose an estimate is the mean squared 
error, which is what it sounds like, the difference between the truth 
and your estimate, squared. This is equal to the bias squared plus the 
variance.

The extra variance of the weighted estimator can be substantial, 
certainly it can be greater than the squared bias of the unweighted 
estimator. It just depends on the process behind the way fish are caught.
