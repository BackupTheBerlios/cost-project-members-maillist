</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi David,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you for your answer - it actually helped me a lot. I understand
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> why you were a bit confused. I tried to cook down too many questions
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> into one quite confusing example! 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In fact, I was talking of many things including several estimates of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> characteristics of the landings based on sub-sampling of the landings or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> by observer trips (length distribution, discard ratios, maturity ogives,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mean weight at age, mean length at age etc). The general question was
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (as you say), should each trip be weighted somehow before they are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> combined and then raised to the total for the strata. The weighting
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> factor could be: total catch (landing + discard)of the trip, total
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> landing of the trip, total effort of the trip etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Am I right, if I conclude that the theoretically statistical correct and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> most general applicable method is to weight each trip because this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> always will give an unbiased result? 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The question if something could be gained in variance by not applying
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> any weighting isn't of interest here because not applying any weighting
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will introduce bias in the estimate. Whether the bias will be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> significant or not, cannot be generally concluded but will depending on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> how successful the stratification is concerning dissolving the trends in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the data. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If this issue is to be discussed further, I suggest that it is done by
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the COST mailing list because it seems to have general interest.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Henrik    
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There are two points here. The first is that the only genuinely unbiased 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> estimator (at least for proportion of landings at length) would be the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one weighted by the number (not the weight) of landings (not catch) in 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> each trip. Using weight of landings in each trip would certainly not be 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unbiased, because bigger fish weigh more, and so you would be 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> overestimating the number of large fish. It's difficult to say what the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> effect of using effort would be.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The second point is that the variance of the estimator is just as 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> important as the bias. What you want is an estimate of the total that is 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> as close to the true value as you can get. If the variance of your 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> estimator is high, you will be no closer than if the bias is high. The 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> only difference with bias is that in the long run, if you make enough 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> estimates, an unbiased estimator will give you as many estimates that 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are too big as it will give estimates that are too small (roughly 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> speaking). This is of no real value because you are interested in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> individual estimate, not some long term properties of all your estimates 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> combined. A good criterion to choose an estimate is the mean squared 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> error, which is what it sounds like, the difference between the truth 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and your estimate, squared. This is equal to the bias squared plus the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> variance.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The extra variance of the weighted estimator can be substantial, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> certainly it can be greater than the squared bias of the unweighted 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> estimator. It just depends on the process behind the way fish are caught.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the general approach to raising, _to be discussed and agreed between 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> all_, should be the following
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *Raising to the total landings (length distribution)*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Data used to raise are (i) total volume of landings of one species or 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (ii) total volume of a commercial category of one species
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (i) the sampling unit is a trip and within each stratum, the samples 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are raised to the trips before being summed and raised to the stratum
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (ii) the sampling unit is a commercial category and within each 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stratum, the samples are simply summed and raised to the stratum.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The rationale is to raise to the sampling unit first before summing 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the samples: (i) is the trip so we raise, (ii) is the CC so we don't 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> need to raise.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *Raising to the total catches (total number or total weight or length 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> distribution of retained part and discarded part)*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Data used to raise are the (i) total number of sampled units (Fishing 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> operations, trips), (ii) total effort (number of days or hours), (iii) 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> any auxiliary variable based on the total landings (species analysed, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> target species, all species, ...)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If the retained part is sorted by CC and we know the total weight by 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> CC at the trip level and/or at the population level (total landings 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> per CC), we don't need to raise. The sampling unit is here the CC. In 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> all other cases (where the sampling unit is the FO), there is the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> choice to raise to the trip and then to the population using the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> number of fishing operations, the effort or an auxiliary variable, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> based on the best correlations and accuracy of the variables used for 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> raising as suggested by WKDRP (San Sebastian, Feeb 2007)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The EDA package will provide the necessary exploratory graphs and the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> raising methods should propose all the possibilities. We have all the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> formulations available and the user will have to make his mind on 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which is the best method to chose.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *Raising the age, weight, maturity and sex*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I launch the discussion by proposing that this process comes to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> creating SMWALKs (Sex-Maturity-Weight-Age-Length-Keys), i.e. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proportion of SMWA-at-length and combine this matrix with the length 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> structure of the population. This results in a matrix raised at the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> population level, where the marginal sums give you either the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> SMWA-at-length or the SMWL-at-age, the columns give the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> SMW-at-length/age and the lines give the SMW-at-age/length.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The sampling unit is one fish and the strata are length + temporal + 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> geographical
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This discussion is a key issue to be further amended/approved by WKMOG 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (how to derive maturity ogive) chaired by David Maxwell in June
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We should first agree on the raising methods before discussing the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> statistical formulation of the variances (second step).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> --------------
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I am open to discussion on each item given above, or probably we need 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to be more explicit and precise and probably there are other cases to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> discuss...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This discussion is the beginning of a more general one on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> algorithms to implement and it is absolutely crucial to all agree on this.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You will also notice that I never talk about proportion-at-length, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> because in this case the sampling unit is a number of fish to measure 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and then you effectively need the total number of fish 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> caught/landed/discarded to raise. In the field, observers usually 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sub-sample the catch/discards (variance of this process unknown?), 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> then identify and weight the species, then sub-sample for sampling 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (variance of this process unknown?). The sub-sampling process may 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> range from a factor 1 (no sub-sampling) to more than 20. A sensitivity 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> analysis made by Mathieu showed that it becomes very dangerous to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sub-sample more than 10 times (quite intuitive but good to know). If 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proportion-at-length is a keystone for Bayesian analysis, how may we 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> draw samples that meet both Bayesian and non-Bayesian expectations? 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and how may we best approximate the total number of fish at the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> population level? In another perspective, is proportion-at-length a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> good solution to cope with high sub-sampling schemes?.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In the cases discussed above (in bold), do the use of weight introduce 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a bias because larger fish weight more than smaller fish? My feeling 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is that the choice of using total weight (imposed by practicalities) 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is more sensitive to bias in term of representitivity of the samples. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> A good sampling protocol should avoid such bias. The use of commercial 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> grading is another way of avoiding this kind of bias.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> After a round of discussion by correspondence, I will propose a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reference document summarising all the agreements. So, participate 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> actively. *This is a call also for the members not developers to step 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in the project.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *Exciting discussions to come, isn't it?*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Best regards

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am struggling to understand exactly what Joel means in most of his 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message, so I will try to clarify what I think this is about:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Raising to the total landings (length distribution)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *I think this means &#8220;how do you estimate the total numbers of fish 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> landed at length?&#8221; (I assume everything is done within a stratum for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> convenience), given that you know the total. Joel gives two situations: 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The data were sampled from trips (ie a random sample of fish were taken 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from a number of trips and their lengths measured), or from &quot;commercial 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> categories&quot;. I assume this means the data were taken from the market 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where they had already been sorted into CC, and so the trip or trips are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not known.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. when sampling the CC, the trip may be known (gear, area fished, 
</I>&gt;<i> auction, ..), which would serve to optimise the stratification.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The first situation seems to be the one I was discussing above. Assuming 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you know the total landings for each sampled trip, you can either get a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> weighted or an unweighted estimate of the total proportion at length, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which you will then have to raise to the total. It is extremely unlikely 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that you will know the total landings in numbers, so you will have to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> estimate the mean weight of a landed fish in order to convert total 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> landed weight to total landed numbers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> Not really. What you do is always get an estimate of the sampled 
</I>&gt;<i> weight. Under market, it is easy as there is always a scales close to 
</I>&gt;<i> you or the sample you take is already weighted. At-sea it is more 
</I>&gt;<i> difficult, here we have invested in very expensive and precise scales, 
</I>&gt;<i> but there is another solution which is to use some length/weight 
</I>&gt;<i> relationship (W = aL^b). The best L/W relationship would be done on 
</I>&gt;<i> that same period and same geographical area in the lab. Once you have 
</I>&gt;<i> your estimate of sampled weight, you can raise by the total weight.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The second situation is probably impossible to do correctly in practice, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in that there is no way a random sample can be taken from the entire CC 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a stratum, unless the fishery is extremely small. If by some chance 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it did happen, the proportion at length in the sample would be an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unbiased estimate of the proportion in the CC, and it would only be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessary to estimate the mean weight to estimate the total numbers at 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> length. What actually happens is that the fish are sampled from an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unknown (but probably small) number of trips, but the details are not 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> known, or unrecorded, or ignored. It is extremely difficult to use this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind of data. Imagine the first situation above, where you had forgotten 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to note which trips the fish were taken from, how many trips there were, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and what the total catch on each trip was. What would you do? The only 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hope is that there is some sort of replication (eg several trips to the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> market), and that each sample is somehow an unbiased estimate of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fish at the market that day. Then you have the same issue of whether or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not to use a weighted estimate, where the weights would be the total 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number in the CC in that market on that day. Note that assuming the fish 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are simply a random sample from the CC (the ideal almost impossible 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> situation) is probably roughly equivalent to using the unweighted 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> estimate from the trip sampling (ie not raising to the trip). Certainly 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the samples came from different trips, and have not been raised to those 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trips.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> ??? What is important is that the  label of your samples (let's say 1, 
</I>&gt;<i> 2, 3, 4 for the example) is exactly the one you will get from the 
</I>&gt;<i> total landings (assumption to test absolutely before doing CC 
</I>&gt;<i> sampling). The second important assumption (always true) is that there 
</I>&gt;<i> is a fixed order of relationship between CC : 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4
</I>&gt;<i> When you sample one box corresponding to a CC, you register the sample 
</I>&gt;<i> weight (w1, w2, w3, w4). for the stratum considered, you will receive 
</I>&gt;<i> (or estimate) the total weight of landings (W1, W2, W3 and W4).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The raising procedure is then simply to sum up all your samples by CC 
</I>&gt;<i> and raise them to the total landings of that CC.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Raising to the total catches (total number or total weight or length 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distribution of retained part and discarded part)*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think this means &#8220;what do you do if you don't know the total?&#8221; This 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will always be the case for discards, and for landings the totals are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not always reliable. 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the fish are sorted into CC before sampling, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then the sampling unit is the trip (within the CC) and the situation is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exactly as the first situation above. If you know the total landings in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the CC on the trip you can choose a weighted or unweighted estimate. If 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you don't have a total for the trip, then you can either use an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unweighted estimate, or use some other variable as a weight (effort 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> etc). The only variable that will give an unbiased estimate is one which 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is proportional to the total number in the trip (landings or discards). 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is not obvious what this might be.
</I>&gt;<i> I agree. That's why we have this EDA function on correlation between 
</I>&gt;<i> the number (or the weight) in the sample and an auxilliary variable. 
</I>&gt;<i> It's up to the user to assess which is the best variable to use. See 
</I>&gt;<i> also all the work done during the ICES WKDRP 
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.ices.dk/reports/acfm/pgccdbs/WKDRP07.pdf">http://www.ices.dk/reports/acfm/pgccdbs/WKDRP07.pdf</A>) and the raising 
</I>&gt;<i> procedure key.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Weight of catch is certainly not 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proportional. Imagine the situation where two trips had exactly the same 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> weight of catch, but one was made up of small fish, and the other of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> large fish. Then there would be fewer fish on the trip with large fish. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The weighted estimate however would simply add the proportions at length 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the two trips together. Therefore the combined estimate would 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overestimate the number of large fish in the total catch. It would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible to use the total catch weight combined with an estimate of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mean weight per fish to get an estimate of the total catch numbers, but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this would add more variance to the total estimate.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is the more or less the most commonly encountered cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One vessel has taken 1 ton of big fish and the other has taken 500 
</I>&gt;<i> kilos of small fish
</I>&gt;<i> Your sample of vessel 1 gives you a length structure of 50 fish for 5 
</I>&gt;<i> kilos
</I>&gt;<i> Your sample of vessel 2 gives you a length structure of 50 fish for 2 
</I>&gt;<i> kilos
</I>&gt;<i> At the end 1000 * 50 /5 + 500 * 50/2 = 22500 fish unbiased with the 
</I>&gt;<i> accurate length structure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The bias would come from the fact that in the example sampling, 50% of 
</I>&gt;<i> the vessel has taken big fish and 50% has taken small fish. This might 
</I>&gt;<i> not be true for the entire population. That is the rationale we have 
</I>&gt;<i> taken to stratify the population by time (quarter, ...), geographical 
</I>&gt;<i> (ICES subdivision, ...) and technical (CC or gear type + mesh size). 
</I>&gt;<i> By doing so, we want to avoid mixing vessels taking big fish and 
</I>&gt;<i> vessels taking small fish in the same stratum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You may wish to use another raising variable. You may know that in the 
</I>&gt;<i> stratum, you have N trips or M Fishing Operations or X hours fished or 
</I>&gt;<i> .... and you may trust this variable and wish to use it for your 
</I>&gt;<i> estimates. The first is a simple raising method, the second is a 
</I>&gt;<i> ratio-to-size estimates and the others are ratio-to-an-auxiliary 
</I>&gt;<i> variable estimates (I wrote a &quot;grey&quot; paper on this during an ICES 
</I>&gt;<i> annual conference, used after during the ICES WKDRP).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Raising the age, weight, maturity and sex*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think this means &#8220;how do we get total catch-at-age (and at weight 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> etc)?&#8221; The usual way to do this is to estimate the numbers at length in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the population, and the age-given-length in the population, and multiply 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them together. Assuming the two estimates are unbiased and independent, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this will give an unbiased estimate of the numbers at age in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> population. Calculating the variance is harder of course. I think Joel 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is saying that the key issue is how to estimate the age given length 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distribution (ie the ALK, or SMALK). 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He also seems to suggest however 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the sampling unit is the fish, ie that all fish in an ALK are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> independent, regardless of how they were sampled. In other words, p(a|l) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is constant across all sampling units, whatever they are. However, Bayes 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> theorem says that p(a|l)=p(l|a)p(a)/p(l). Even if we accept the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (implausible) hypothesis that p(l|a) is constant across sampling units, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ie that all fish everywhere grow at the same rate, then p(a|l) can only 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be constant if p(a)/p(l) is constant. This can only be true if both p(a) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and p(l) are constant, and this is obviously not true. 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, but p(a | l) constant does not mean that each of the three 
</I>&gt;<i> probabilities p(l | a), p(a) and p(l) are constants.
</I>&gt;<i> I mean that here again there is a stratification issue. We know there 
</I>&gt;<i> is a growth pattern in the ALK so we must define strata with 
</I>&gt;<i> homogeneous growth. Here we have two levels of stratification only : 
</I>&gt;<i> time and geographical area. In the EDA package you will find a method 
</I>&gt;<i> to analyse your different samples and assess your best stratification. 
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, do we consider the length class as a stratum? It is 
</I>&gt;<i> important in the case of bootstrap to know if length is a grouping 
</I>&gt;<i> variable or not? Maybe there are different cases to consider. If we 
</I>&gt;<i> build the ALK by getting n fish per length classes, that means that LC 
</I>&gt;<i> is a stratification. If we get otoliths by a subsampling process, it 
</I>&gt;<i> is not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I aknowledge that saying that an individual fish is the sampling unit 
</I>&gt;<i> is probably not true. I'm opened to discussion on this point. It can 
</I>&gt;<i> be a group of fish taken during the same (more or less precise) period 
</I>&gt;<i> and the same (more or less precise) location. &quot;More or less precise&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> may be confusing here but when you're on-board fishing vessels and 
</I>&gt;<i> take otoliths every hours ans every FO, there must be a way to combine 
</I>&gt;<i> them into a day and an ICES rectangle or a month and an ICES 
</I>&gt;<i> sub-division, etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To give a simple 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example, suppose one boat only catches young fish (say less than 5) and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another only catches old fish (say greater than or equal to 5). There 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will still be some overlap in the length distribution. Say there is some 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> length L which is on both boats. Then p(age=5|length=L) is zero on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first boat, but not on the second. Similarly p(age=4|length=L) is zero 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the second boat but not on the first. Thus the sampling of the ages 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has to be taken into account. One way to do this would be to calculate 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an age distribution on each trip (if that is the sampling unit), but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that requires age data from each trip.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don&#8217;t understand the final part of Joel&#8217;s message. He says &#8220;I never 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> talk about proportion at length&#8230;&#8221; but as far as I can see almost all the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion is about proportion at length. What is meant here?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> I thought by proportion-at-length you meant probabilities of one fish 
</I>&gt;<i> being a given length (sum of all probs = 1). It is possible to say 
</I>&gt;<i> that each of the length samples is representative of the 
</I>&gt;<i> probabilities-at-length and just take the mean (weighted or 
</I>&gt;<i> unweighted) over all these probabilities-at-length. If you do this, 
</I>&gt;<i> the total weight does not give you any help and you desperately need 
</I>&gt;<i> the total Number of fish in the population !
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is likely that we are talking about the same thing with different 
</I>&gt;<i> languages. It is really important that we begin writing all this in a 
</I>&gt;<i> common document we all agree on, which will be the common basis for 
</I>&gt;<i> the development. Given my agenda, we can keep on discussing here for a 
</I>&gt;<i> while before I begin a Wiki.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards

</I>The fundamental issues here are how do we estimate landings and discards 
at age (or weight etc, and maybe you don't need discards at age ...) and 
most importantly how do we know the uncertainty in our estimates? The 
key point is that the age (and size) distribution of fish differ from 
haul to haul and trip to trip. This makes it extremely important to know 
what your sampling unit is. The sampling unit is the thing you will 
randomly sample your fish from.

First, raising landings from market sampling sorted into CCs: Joel says  
&quot;The raising procedure is then simply to sum up all your samples by CC 
and raise them to the total landings of that CC.&quot;

Ok, that will give you a point estimate. The trouble is you don't have a 
random sample from the market, either within each CC or not. What you 
usually have is a combined sample from a few trips, each of which might 
be regarded as being randomly sampled. If you knew the trip information 
(eg if you had done your sampling directly from the trips), then you 
would get some estimate, probably by raising to the trip level (though 
this is not necessarily best). This estimate would have some uncertainty 
that you have a chance of measuring. When you follow Joel's advice, you 
get a different estimate (for a start there is no raising to the trip) 
even though your data is actually the same. So how are you going to 
measure the uncertainty here? It is very difficult because you have lost 
the trip information. It is no good just assuming every fish is 
independent, because this will grossly underestimate the uncertainty.

Another important point is in the estimation of the ALK. I show that 
p(a|l) cannot be constant unless p(a), p(l) and p(l|a) are constant, 
then Joel says &quot;I agree, but p(a | l) constant does not mean that each 
of the three probabilities p(l | a), p(a) and p(l) are constants.&quot; So I 
don't know what Joel is agreeing with. My point is that the trip (or 
haul) must be the sampling unit for the ALK as well as for the length 
distribution. This has nothing to do with stratification. This means 
that it is no more correct to assume all the fish are randomly sampled 
for the ALK than for the length distribution. This means it is difficult 
to correctly estimate the uncertainty in the catch-at-age if the source 
of the ALK data is not known.

The final point is that Joel does not discuss the use of weighted or 
unweighted estimators (which is where this started). There is a comment 
in the ICES WKDRP that the group thought that unbiased estimators were 
best, regardless of the extra uncertainty. There is however no 
justification for this (and it is clearly not true, presented with an 
unbiased estimator with a variance of 10000, and another with a bias of 
1 but a variance of only 10 I think everyone would go for the biased 
estimator). This is a very important issue.

I still don't understand Joel's comment about proportion at length. All 
the estimation methods involve estimating the proportion at length in 
some unit (trip or haul or whatever) then using this in some way to 
estimate the proportion at length in the total (along with the total 
numbers).
