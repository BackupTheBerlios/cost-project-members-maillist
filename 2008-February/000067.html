</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi David,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you for your answer - it actually helped me a lot. I understand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> why you were a bit confused. I tried to cook down too many questions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into one quite confusing example! 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In fact, I was talking of many things including several estimates of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> characteristics of the landings based on sub-sampling of the landings or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by observer trips (length distribution, discard ratios, maturity ogives,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mean weight at age, mean length at age etc). The general question was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (as you say), should each trip be weighted somehow before they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> combined and then raised to the total for the strata. The weighting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> factor could be: total catch (landing + discard)of the trip, total
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> landing of the trip, total effort of the trip etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Am I right, if I conclude that the theoretically statistical correct and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most general applicable method is to weight each trip because this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> always will give an unbiased result? 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The question if something could be gained in variance by not applying
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any weighting isn't of interest here because not applying any weighting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will introduce bias in the estimate. Whether the bias will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> significant or not, cannot be generally concluded but will depending on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how successful the stratification is concerning dissolving the trends in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the data. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If this issue is to be discussed further, I suggest that it is done by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the COST mailing list because it seems to have general interest.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Henrik    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> There are two points here. The first is that the only genuinely unbiased 
</I>&gt;<i> estimator (at least for proportion of landings at length) would be the 
</I>&gt;<i> one weighted by the number (not the weight) of landings (not catch) in 
</I>&gt;<i> each trip. Using weight of landings in each trip would certainly not be 
</I>&gt;<i> unbiased, because bigger fish weigh more, and so you would be 
</I>&gt;<i> overestimating the number of large fish. It's difficult to say what the 
</I>&gt;<i> effect of using effort would be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second point is that the variance of the estimator is just as 
</I>&gt;<i> important as the bias. What you want is an estimate of the total that is 
</I>&gt;<i> as close to the true value as you can get. If the variance of your 
</I>&gt;<i> estimator is high, you will be no closer than if the bias is high. The 
</I>&gt;<i> only difference with bias is that in the long run, if you make enough 
</I>&gt;<i> estimates, an unbiased estimator will give you as many estimates that 
</I>&gt;<i> are too big as it will give estimates that are too small (roughly 
</I>&gt;<i> speaking). This is of no real value because you are interested in the 
</I>&gt;<i> individual estimate, not some long term properties of all your estimates 
</I>&gt;<i> combined. A good criterion to choose an estimate is the mean squared 
</I>&gt;<i> error, which is what it sounds like, the difference between the truth 
</I>&gt;<i> and your estimate, squared. This is equal to the bias squared plus the 
</I>&gt;<i> variance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The extra variance of the weighted estimator can be substantial, 
</I>&gt;<i> certainly it can be greater than the squared bias of the unweighted 
</I>&gt;<i> estimator. It just depends on the process behind the way fish are caught.

</I>Dear all,

the general approach to raising, _to be discussed and agreed between 
all_, should be the following

*Raising to the total landings (length distribution)*

Data used to raise are (i) total volume of landings of one species or 
(ii) total volume of a commercial category of one species
(i) the sampling unit is a trip and within each stratum, the samples are 
raised to the trips before being summed and raised to the stratum
(ii) the sampling unit is a commercial category and within each stratum, 
the samples are simply summed and raised to the stratum.
The rationale is to raise to the sampling unit first before summing the 
samples: (i) is the trip so we raise, (ii) is the CC so we don't need to 
raise.

*Raising to the total catches (total number or total weight or length 
distribution of retained part and discarded part)*

Data used to raise are the (i) total number of sampled units (Fishing 
operations, trips), (ii) total effort (number of days or hours), (iii) 
any auxiliary variable based on the total landings (species analysed, 
target species, all species, ...)

If the retained part is sorted by CC and we know the total weight by CC 
at the trip level and/or at the population level (total landings per 
CC), we don't need to raise. The sampling unit is here the CC. In all 
other cases (where the sampling unit is the FO), there is the choice to 
raise to the trip and then to the population using the number of fishing 
operations, the effort or an auxiliary variable, based on the best 
correlations and accuracy of the variables used for raising as suggested 
by WKDRP (San Sebastian, Feeb 2007)
The EDA package will provide the necessary exploratory graphs and the 
raising methods should propose all the possibilities. We have all the 
formulations available and the user will have to make his mind on which 
is the best method to chose.

*Raising the age, weight, maturity and sex*

I launch the discussion by proposing that this process comes to creating 
SMWALKs (Sex-Maturity-Weight-Age-Length-Keys), i.e. proportion of 
SMWA-at-length and combine this matrix with the length structure of the 
population. This results in a matrix raised at the population level, 
where the marginal sums give you either the SMWA-at-length or the 
SMWL-at-age, the columns give the SMW-at-length/age and the lines give 
the SMW-at-age/length.
The sampling unit is one fish and the strata are length + temporal + 
geographical
This discussion is a key issue to be further amended/approved by WKMOG 
(how to derive maturity ogive) chaired by David Maxwell in June

We should first agree on the raising methods before discussing the 
statistical formulation of the variances (second step).

--------------
I am open to discussion on each item given above, or probably we need to 
be more explicit and precise and probably there are other cases to 
discuss...
This discussion is the beginning of a more general one on the algorithms 
to implement and it is absolutely crucial to all agree on this.

You will also notice that I never talk about proportion-at-length, 
because in this case the sampling unit is a number of fish to measure 
and then you effectively need the total number of fish 
caught/landed/discarded to raise. In the field, observers usually 
sub-sample the catch/discards (variance of this process unknown?), then 
identify and weight the species, then sub-sample for sampling (variance 
of this process unknown?). The sub-sampling process may range from a 
factor 1 (no sub-sampling) to more than 20. A sensitivity analysis made 
by Mathieu showed that it becomes very dangerous to sub-sample more than 
10 times (quite intuitive but good to know). If proportion-at-length is 
a keystone for Bayesian analysis, how may we draw samples that meet both 
Bayesian and non-Bayesian expectations? and how may we best approximate 
the total number of fish at the population level? In another 
perspective, is proportion-at-length a good solution to cope with high 
sub-sampling schemes?.
In the cases discussed above (in bold), do the use of weight introduce a 
bias because larger fish weight more than smaller fish? My feeling is 
that the choice of using total weight (imposed by practicalities) is 
more sensitive to bias in term of representitivity of the samples. A 
good sampling protocol should avoid such bias. The use of commercial 
grading is another way of avoiding this kind of bias.

After a round of discussion by correspondence, I will propose a 
reference document summarising all the agreements. So, participate 
actively. *This is a call also for the members not developers to step in 
the project.

*Exciting discussions to come, isn't it?*
*
Best regards

Joel
