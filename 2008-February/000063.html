</I>&gt;<i> From: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/cost-project-members">Hd at difres.dk</A> [mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/cost-project-members">Hd at difres.dk</A>]
</I>&gt;<i> Sent: 05 February 2008 12:10
</I>&gt;<i> To: David Maxwell (Cefas)
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Raising of samples
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dear David,
</I>&gt;<i> I have put the following on the discussion forum for
</I>&gt;<i> COST but I don't know if it is read by the relevant
</I>&gt;<i> persons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dear all (statisticians),
</I>&gt;<i> I am working with the design specification of some new
</I>&gt;<i> versions of the raising procedure in FishFrame and have
</I>&gt;<i> a problem which I believe is relevant for COST as well. I
</I>&gt;<i> am talking about raising (species dist. and length dist.)
</I>&gt;<i> from sample level to total landings. The raising is
</I>&gt;<i> stratified on: country, Year, quarter, metier, area (and
</I>&gt;<i> species). The samples are assumed to random samples
</I>&gt;<i> of the landings and there is full record of all landings.
</I>&gt;<i> My problem is if it is correct to apply some measures for
</I>&gt;<i> the catch amount (not sample size) connected to the
</I>&gt;<i> sample as weighting factor (e.g. the catch weight or
</I>&gt;<i> effort depending of raising method). I have briefly
</I>&gt;<i> discussed the issue with Joel and he strongly
</I>&gt;<i> recommended that no weighting was introduced. I can
</I>&gt;<i> see the point if we were estimating the species
</I>&gt;<i> distribution in the underlying population (in the stock.
</I>&gt;<i> In that case the catch itself is a sub-sample), but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> understand why it is correct when we want to estimate
</I>&gt;<i> the distribution in the landings (which has an
</I>&gt;<i> underlying distribution of landing amounts). In my logic
</I>&gt;<i> a weighting with the catch amount is the same as to
</I>&gt;<i> estimate the species dist/length dist. in each landing
</I>&gt;<i> and then sum all landings for a given metier (stratum).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would be very happy if I could get an advice what to
</I>&gt;<i> do.
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you in advance,
</I>&gt;<i> Henrik
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello Henrik,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am replying to the COST mailing list because the discussion forum 
</I>&gt;<i> is not being used.
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly the same question needs to be answered in COST so I hope 
</I>&gt;<i> there are more replies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For length distribution of commercial landings the traditional 
</I>&gt;<i> approach at Cefas is to use vessel raising. This is a weighted sum of 
</I>&gt;<i> samples as you described.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With weighting the questionable assumption is that a sample from a 
</I>&gt;<i> large landing gives more information than a sample from a small 
</I>&gt;<i> landing.
</I>&gt;<i> But the advantage is that if you sample all the landings then 
</I>&gt;<i> weighting will give the observed total and I don't think this is true 
</I>&gt;<i> if an unweighted average is raised to the stratum total landings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looking at Joel's formulae for D_j in the working document included 
</I>&gt;<i> as part of the COST project Appendix may help this discussion.
</I>&gt;<i> Vigneau &amp; Mahevas (2004) Precision in catch at age data with regard 
</I>&gt;<i> to sampling design. Working document for the WKSMFD(Nantes 
</I>&gt;<i> 26-31/01/2004).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> David.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Dear all,

I'm currently co-chairing the joint SGRN-SGECA meeting to 
revise/rewrite the new DCR until Friday. Don't hesitate to express your 
views on the important issue of raising procedures. I cannot 
concentrate on this for the moment but I promise I will express my view 
early next week.

I remind also that next week will be the time to write the COST interim 
report with the final DEFS, the COSTcore version 1.0 package and the 
current development of the EDA package. In addition, we'll make a 
precise point on where we are and what is the current state of 
progression for all the packages.

Thank you for your attention and sorry for the digression with the 
second paragraph.

Best regards

Joel
