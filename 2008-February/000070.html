</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> factor could be: total catch (landing + discard)of the trip, total
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> landing of the trip, total effort of the trip etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Am I right, if I conclude that the theoretically statistical correct and

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> how successful the stratification is concerning dissolving the trends in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the data. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If this issue is to be discussed further, I suggest that it is done by
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the COST mailing list because it seems to have general interest.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Henrik    
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are two points here. The first is that the only genuinely unbiased 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> estimator (at least for proportion of landings at length) would be the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one weighted by the number (not the weight) of landings (not catch) in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each trip. Using weight of landings in each trip would certainly not be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unbiased, because bigger fish weigh more, and so you would be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overestimating the number of large fish. It's difficult to say what the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effect of using effort would be.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The second point is that the variance of the estimator is just as 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important as the bias. What you want is an estimate of the total that is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as close to the true value as you can get. If the variance of your 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> estimator is high, you will be no closer than if the bias is high. The 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only difference with bias is that in the long run, if you make enough 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> estimates, an unbiased estimator will give you as many estimates that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are too big as it will give estimates that are too small (roughly 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> speaking). This is of no real value because you are interested in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individual estimate, not some long term properties of all your estimates 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> combined. A good criterion to choose an estimate is the mean squared 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> error, which is what it sounds like, the difference between the truth 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and your estimate, squared. This is equal to the bias squared plus the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> variance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The extra variance of the weighted estimator can be substantial, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certainly it can be greater than the squared bias of the unweighted 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> estimator. It just depends on the process behind the way fish are caught.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the general approach to raising, _to be discussed and agreed between 
</I>&gt;<i> all_, should be the following
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Raising to the total landings (length distribution)*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Data used to raise are (i) total volume of landings of one species or 
</I>&gt;<i> (ii) total volume of a commercial category of one species
</I>&gt;<i> (i) the sampling unit is a trip and within each stratum, the samples 
</I>&gt;<i> are raised to the trips before being summed and raised to the stratum
</I>&gt;<i> (ii) the sampling unit is a commercial category and within each 
</I>&gt;<i> stratum, the samples are simply summed and raised to the stratum.
</I>&gt;<i> The rationale is to raise to the sampling unit first before summing 
</I>&gt;<i> the samples: (i) is the trip so we raise, (ii) is the CC so we don't 
</I>&gt;<i> need to raise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Raising to the total catches (total number or total weight or length 
</I>&gt;<i> distribution of retained part and discarded part)*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Data used to raise are the (i) total number of sampled units (Fishing 
</I>&gt;<i> operations, trips), (ii) total effort (number of days or hours), (iii) 
</I>&gt;<i> any auxiliary variable based on the total landings (species analysed, 
</I>&gt;<i> target species, all species, ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the retained part is sorted by CC and we know the total weight by 
</I>&gt;<i> CC at the trip level and/or at the population level (total landings 
</I>&gt;<i> per CC), we don't need to raise. The sampling unit is here the CC. In 
</I>&gt;<i> all other cases (where the sampling unit is the FO), there is the 
</I>&gt;<i> choice to raise to the trip and then to the population using the 
</I>&gt;<i> number of fishing operations, the effort or an auxiliary variable, 
</I>&gt;<i> based on the best correlations and accuracy of the variables used for 
</I>&gt;<i> raising as suggested by WKDRP (San Sebastian, Feeb 2007)
</I>&gt;<i> The EDA package will provide the necessary exploratory graphs and the 
</I>&gt;<i> raising methods should propose all the possibilities. We have all the 
</I>&gt;<i> formulations available and the user will have to make his mind on 
</I>&gt;<i> which is the best method to chose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Raising the age, weight, maturity and sex*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I launch the discussion by proposing that this process comes to 
</I>&gt;<i> creating SMWALKs (Sex-Maturity-Weight-Age-Length-Keys), i.e. 
</I>&gt;<i> proportion of SMWA-at-length and combine this matrix with the length 
</I>&gt;<i> structure of the population. This results in a matrix raised at the 
</I>&gt;<i> population level, where the marginal sums give you either the 
</I>&gt;<i> SMWA-at-length or the SMWL-at-age, the columns give the 
</I>&gt;<i> SMW-at-length/age and the lines give the SMW-at-age/length.
</I>&gt;<i> The sampling unit is one fish and the strata are length + temporal + 
</I>&gt;<i> geographical
</I>&gt;<i> This discussion is a key issue to be further amended/approved by WKMOG 
</I>&gt;<i> (how to derive maturity ogive) chaired by David Maxwell in June
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We should first agree on the raising methods before discussing the 
</I>&gt;<i> statistical formulation of the variances (second step).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --------------
</I>&gt;<i> I am open to discussion on each item given above, or probably we need 
</I>&gt;<i> to be more explicit and precise and probably there are other cases to 
</I>&gt;<i> discuss...
</I>&gt;<i> This discussion is the beginning of a more general one on the 
</I>&gt;<i> algorithms to implement and it is absolutely crucial to all agree on this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You will also notice that I never talk about proportion-at-length, 
</I>&gt;<i> because in this case the sampling unit is a number of fish to measure 
</I>&gt;<i> and then you effectively need the total number of fish 
</I>&gt;<i> caught/landed/discarded to raise. In the field, observers usually 
</I>&gt;<i> sub-sample the catch/discards (variance of this process unknown?), 
</I>&gt;<i> then identify and weight the species, then sub-sample for sampling 
</I>&gt;<i> (variance of this process unknown?). The sub-sampling process may 
</I>&gt;<i> range from a factor 1 (no sub-sampling) to more than 20. A sensitivity 
</I>&gt;<i> analysis made by Mathieu showed that it becomes very dangerous to 
</I>&gt;<i> sub-sample more than 10 times (quite intuitive but good to know). If 
</I>&gt;<i> proportion-at-length is a keystone for Bayesian analysis, how may we 
</I>&gt;<i> draw samples that meet both Bayesian and non-Bayesian expectations? 
</I>&gt;<i> and how may we best approximate the total number of fish at the 
</I>&gt;<i> population level? In another perspective, is proportion-at-length a 
</I>&gt;<i> good solution to cope with high sub-sampling schemes?.
</I>&gt;<i> In the cases discussed above (in bold), do the use of weight introduce 
</I>&gt;<i> a bias because larger fish weight more than smaller fish? My feeling 
</I>&gt;<i> is that the choice of using total weight (imposed by practicalities) 
</I>&gt;<i> is more sensitive to bias in term of representitivity of the samples. 
</I>&gt;<i> A good sampling protocol should avoid such bias. The use of commercial 
</I>&gt;<i> grading is another way of avoiding this kind of bias.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After a round of discussion by correspondence, I will propose a 
</I>&gt;<i> reference document summarising all the agreements. So, participate 
</I>&gt;<i> actively. *This is a call also for the members not developers to step 
</I>&gt;<i> in the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Exciting discussions to come, isn't it?*
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards
</I>&gt;<i>

I am struggling to understand exactly what Joel means in most of his 
message, so I will try to clarify what I think this is about:

*Raising to the total landings (length distribution)
*I think this means &#8220;how do you estimate the total numbers of fish 
landed at length?&#8221; (I assume everything is done within a stratum for 
convenience), given that you know the total. Joel gives two situations: 
The data were sampled from trips (ie a random sample of fish were taken 
from a number of trips and their lengths measured), or from &quot;commercial 
categories&quot;. I assume this means the data were taken from the market 
where they had already been sorted into CC, and so the trip or trips are 
not known.

The first situation seems to be the one I was discussing above. Assuming 
you know the total landings for each sampled trip, you can either get a 
weighted or an unweighted estimate of the total proportion at length, 
which you will then have to raise to the total. It is extremely unlikely 
that you will know the total landings in numbers, so you will have to 
estimate the mean weight of a landed fish in order to convert total 
landed weight to total landed numbers.

The second situation is probably impossible to do correctly in practice, 
in that there is no way a random sample can be taken from the entire CC 
in a stratum, unless the fishery is extremely small. If by some chance 
it did happen, the proportion at length in the sample would be an 
unbiased estimate of the proportion in the CC, and it would only be 
necessary to estimate the mean weight to estimate the total numbers at 
length. What actually happens is that the fish are sampled from an 
unknown (but probably small) number of trips, but the details are not 
known, or unrecorded, or ignored. It is extremely difficult to use this 
kind of data. Imagine the first situation above, where you had forgotten 
to note which trips the fish were taken from, how many trips there were, 
and what the total catch on each trip was. What would you do? The only 
hope is that there is some sort of replication (eg several trips to the 
market), and that each sample is somehow an unbiased estimate of the 
fish at the market that day. Then you have the same issue of whether or 
not to use a weighted estimate, where the weights would be the total 
number in the CC in that market on that day. Note that assuming the fish 
are simply a random sample from the CC (the ideal almost impossible 
situation) is probably roughly equivalent to using the unweighted 
estimate from the trip sampling (ie not raising to the trip). Certainly 
the samples came from different trips, and have not been raised to those 
trips.

*Raising to the total catches (total number or total weight or length 
distribution of retained part and discarded part)*

I think this means &#8220;what do you do if you don't know the total?&#8221; This 
will always be the case for discards, and for landings the totals are 
not always reliable. If the fish are sorted into CC before sampling, 
then the sampling unit is the trip (within the CC) and the situation is 
exactly as the first situation above. If you know the total landings in 
the CC on the trip you can choose a weighted or unweighted estimate. If 
you don't have a total for the trip, then you can either use an 
unweighted estimate, or use some other variable as a weight (effort 
etc). The only variable that will give an unbiased estimate is one which 
is proportional to the total number in the trip (landings or discards). 
It is not obvious what this might be. Weight of catch is certainly not 
proportional. Imagine the situation where two trips had exactly the same 
weight of catch, but one was made up of small fish, and the other of 
large fish. Then there would be fewer fish on the trip with large fish. 
The weighted estimate however would simply add the proportions at length 
for the two trips together. Therefore the combined estimate would 
overestimate the number of large fish in the total catch. It would be 
possible to use the total catch weight combined with an estimate of the 
mean weight per fish to get an estimate of the total catch numbers, but 
this would add more variance to the total estimate.

*Raising the age, weight, maturity and sex*

I think this means &#8220;how do we get total catch-at-age (and at weight 
etc)?&#8221; The usual way to do this is to estimate the numbers at length in 
the population, and the age-given-length in the population, and multiply 
them together. Assuming the two estimates are unbiased and independent, 
this will give an unbiased estimate of the numbers at age in the 
population. Calculating the variance is harder of course. I think Joel 
is saying that the key issue is how to estimate the age given length 
distribution (ie the ALK, or SMALK). He also seems to suggest however 
that the sampling unit is the fish, ie that all fish in an ALK are 
independent, regardless of how they were sampled. In other words, p(a|l) 
is constant across all sampling units, whatever they are. However, Bayes 
theorem says that p(a|l)=p(l|a)p(a)/p(l). Even if we accept the 
(implausible) hypothesis that p(l|a) is constant across sampling units, 
ie that all fish everywhere grow at the same rate, then p(a|l) can only 
be constant if p(a)/p(l) is constant. This can only be true if both p(a) 
and p(l) are constant, and this is obviously not true. To give a simple 
example, suppose one boat only catches young fish (say less than 5) and 
another only catches old fish (say greater than or equal to 5). There 
will still be some overlap in the length distribution. Say there is some 
length L which is on both boats. Then p(age=5|length=L) is zero on the 
first boat, but not on the second. Similarly p(age=4|length=L) is zero 
on the second boat but not on the first. Thus the sampling of the ages 
has to be taken into account. One way to do this would be to calculate 
an age distribution on each trip (if that is the sampling unit), but 
that requires age data from each trip.

I don&#8217;t understand the final part of Joel&#8217;s message. He says &#8220;I never 
talk about proportion at length&#8230;&#8221; but as far as I can see almost all the 
discussion is about proportion at length. What is meant here?
