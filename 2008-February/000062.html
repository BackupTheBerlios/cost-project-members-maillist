Subject: Raising of samples


Dear David,
I have put the following on the discussion forum for 
COST but I don't know if it is read by the relevant 
persons.


Dear all (statisticians),
I am working with the design specification of some new 
versions of the raising procedure in FishFrame and have 
a problem which I believe is relevant for COST as well. I 
am talking about raising (species dist. and length dist.) 
from sample level to total landings. The raising is 
stratified on: country, Year, quarter, metier, area (and 
species). The samples are assumed to random samples 
of the landings and there is full record of all landings. 
My problem is if it is correct to apply some measures for 
the catch amount (not sample size) connected to the 
sample as weighting factor (e.g. the catch weight or 
effort depending of raising method). I have briefly 
discussed the issue with Joel and he strongly 
recommended that no weighting was introduced. I can 
see the point if we were estimating the species 
distribution in the underlying population (in the stock. 
In that case the catch itself is a sub-sample), but I don't 
understand why it is correct when we want to estimate 
the distribution in the landings (which has an 
underlying distribution of landing amounts). In my logic 
a weighting with the catch amount is the same as to 
estimate the species dist/length dist. in each landing 
and then sum all landings for a given metier (stratum).

I would be very happy if I could get an advice what to 
do.
Thank you in advance,
Henrik

Hello Henrik,

I am replying to the COST mailing list because the discussion forum is not being used.
Exactly the same question needs to be answered in COST so I hope there are more replies.

For length distribution of commercial landings the traditional approach at Cefas is to use vessel raising. This is a weighted sum of samples as you described.

With weighting the questionable assumption is that a sample from a large landing gives more information than a sample from a small landing.
But the advantage is that if you sample all the landings then weighting will give the observed total and I don't think this is true if an unweighted average is raised to the stratum total landings.

Looking at Joel's formulae for D_j in the working document included as part of the COST project Appendix may help this discussion.
Vigneau &amp; Mahevas (2004) Precision in catch at age data with regard to sampling design. Working document for the WKSMFD(Nantes 26-31/01/2004). 

David.
