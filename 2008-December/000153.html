<PRE>Dear COST members,

in order to ease our end of the year holidays and party time, and on my 
demand, the European Commission has signed an amendment to the COST 
contract stipulating that the duration of the project shall not exceed 
22 months. In real words, this means that we have 4 extra months, i.e. 
until the end of April 2009 to provide the scentific community with the 
full sets of methods, packages and reports.

You might think it is fine with regards to our agenda, but I'm still 
thinking this will require a lot of effort from everyone until April. I 
remind that up to now, the calculation packages (dbe and mbe) are not 
available on their version 0.1, which was scheduled for the end of 
November. We have problem with our deadlines, everyone must be aware 
that we won't have a second prolongation. This was a one shot option. I 
really much call upon having version 0.1 of dbe and mbe right at the 
start of 2009 for testing and debugging.

Then it will be time to focus on the reporting : user manual, examples, 
technical manual. The technical manual must prepare the ground for some 
publication on methods used and on the comparison of methods following 
the simulation package.I'll come up with structures of reports for the 
manuals during January.

The DEF has been the object of endless discussion and modification, 
which must have confused most of you  on the opportunity to construct 
your own datasets!  The latest amendments were minor changes and the 
document on the COST website may be used today to construct such 
datasets. As soon as we have a version 0.1 of the calculation packages, 
it will be time for each of you to export your data and test the methods 
on a large scale.

I wish you all very good time with your friends and families for this 
end of the year.

Best regards

Joel
