</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> let me summarise the situation to see if we have the same understanding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What we agree :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> FF.CS + FF.AS + DATRAS make a complete and non-overlapping picture of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all the fisheries information sampled.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> COST has based its structure on FF.CS but needs biological parameters

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The FF/COST DEF table CA now contains biological parameters from 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individual fish.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What remains under discussion :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are still different options and even variants within the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> options proposed by Teunis. The option 2, which seems to gather the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most advantages, makes a CA table in COST DEF independent of CS in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the sense that we would not mandatorily request related information 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in HL. There is a variant of 3 different CA tables or a unique one. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My preference goes to a unique one (I think there are not many 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> differences). For opening to the future, we could add a field 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DATA_SOURCE (CS, AS, Surveys, ...). When the source is CS, we need to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have a related information in HL, otherwise, for the moment there is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no integrity check.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we go that way, do we have sufficient information in the CA table, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> especially concerning the time period when the source is not HL?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The stratification issue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not surprised with your graph. The CC is a stratification based 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on individual weight, which according to the length/weight allometry 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correspond approximately to a stratification by length. In the small 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fish category, the mean length-at-age for every ages will be smaller 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than in the medium fish category, which all will be smaller than in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the big fish category. The only way to get out of this, is to combine 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all the CC into a complete matrix and multiply by the real length 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proportion of the population, before doing any estimates.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Joel,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think your summary is correct but I'd like to elaborate a little bit 
</I>&gt;<i> more on CA tables.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This information comes from 3 different sources, (i) market sampling, 
</I>&gt;<i> (ii) on-board sampling and (iii) surveys, which differ in their 
</I>&gt;<i> aggregation level. Most aggregated is market sampling where area and 
</I>&gt;<i> time units are, at the most, rectangle and day. After we have on-board 
</I>&gt;<i> sampling where sometimes its possible to have coordinates and time in 
</I>&gt;<i> hour:minutes. The most disaggregated is survey data where we have 
</I>&gt;<i> coordinates and time. The information related with the individual is 
</I>&gt;<i> the same for all, although sometimes there are some missing 
</I>&gt;<i> observations (one may sample age and not maturity, etc).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Based on this rationale we may create a data structure that combines 
</I>&gt;<i> area, rectangle, coordinates, day, hour with data source (this is 
</I>&gt;<i> similar to sampling type so we may use that field):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> sampType; area, rectangle, latIni, lonIni, latFin, lonFin, dateIni, 
</I>&gt;<i> dateFin, hourIni, hourFin, stock, spp, sex, etc (country, length, age, 
</I>&gt;<i> blah blah blah)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> area, rectangle and dateFin would be mandatory so that market sampling 
</I>&gt;<i> can be included and the other fields would be filled based on 
</I>&gt;<i> sampType. A survey could provide everything lat, lon, hour, etc, while 
</I>&gt;<i> on-board sampling could provide some of this information. This way we 
</I>&gt;<i> could develop a data structure for individual biopars and link with CS 
</I>&gt;<i> using rectangle, date, spp etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My doubts are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) although biopars are independent from the fishery we know that the 
</I>&gt;<i> selectivity of the gear can bias the sampling, so I guess we should 
</I>&gt;<i> keep some information about the gear used to collect the sample;
</I>&gt;<i> 2) how far can we go with this and still keep compatibility with FF ? 
</I>&gt;<i> A change like this would require some adjustments to FF5 and FF5 
</I>&gt;<i> exchange format. Are you whiling to do it ? Otherwise it makes no 
</I>&gt;<i> sense implementing only in COST and we should just keep it as it is now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMO if we go this path we should stop developing CA for now, discuss 
</I>&gt;<i> the data structure until we have an agreement and after implement FF5, 
</I>&gt;<i> FF5 exchange format and COST classes. In the mean time other packages 
</I>&gt;<i> could move on with length frequencies methods.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>Hi Ernesto,

it's sure we have a structural problem here that cannot be resolved at a 
glance. So let's not hurry to find out the best solution keeping a full 
convergence between COST and FF.

I agree with your approach (Sampling type will give us the source; area, 
rectangle and datefin are mandatory fields, ...) and concerning your 
doubts, the linkage between CA and HH should provide the gear 
information and its basic characteristics (when the source is 
commercial). I think we can live for the moment without this info for 
the surveys.

If we can fix this (Teunis and Henrik, is it Ok for you?), I think we 
can begin COST development with this structure. In parallel, we can 
continue the work with FF and come much later with a revision of the 
DEF. Anyway, the development and the beta-testing will bring other 
issues at the surface ....

We will have to agree on the fact that from now on, and within the life 
of the project, we can only change the DEF once (so better be for good!).

BR

Joel
