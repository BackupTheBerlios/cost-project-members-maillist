<PRE>Hi
I assume that live weights (=whole weights) always are uploaded. This have been the rule in FishFrame and is mentioned in the comments in the exchange format description. (I admit that looking at the format description again (p. 12) it isn'n crystal clear for market sampling as live weight only is mentioned under Sea sampling. When COST isn't including the variance in connection with the conversion I consider the conversion from any condition to live weight as a national issue which should be handled before upload in order to make input data streamlined and not too complicated. Believe me, things gets rearly complex later on dealing with raising, etc. I suggest that only live (=fresh, =whole-)weights are uploaded and that it is clearly explained in the format description. 

Best regards,
Henrik

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi all
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am now member of the mailing list and have a comment to the question 
</I>&gt;<i> raised by David Maxwell about converting sefas data to DEF. One of the 
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion is to include an indication in the SL record of on which 
</I>&gt;<i> basis the weight estimation is made (whole, gutted...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can see David's point if COST is going to include the additional 
</I>&gt;<i> variance connected to the converting from gutted weight to whole 
</I>&gt;<i> weight. If this variance is going to be considered, we need not just 
</I>&gt;<i> an indication but we need the conversion factor and the associated 
</I>&gt;<i> variance too (assuming that the conversion factor is a mean value of a 
</I>&gt;<i> number of measures).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If COST isn't going to consider this variance, I think the information 
</I>&gt;<i> is irrelevant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>Hi,

No variance calculation of that sort in COST, it will complexify too much for a result probably marginal compared to the (im)precision we have on the catch figures.

The point is that we have to ascertain that information in SL match information in CL and that information in CL can be merged between countries.

As we cannot add gutted and whole fish together, we have two options
1 - add a field PRESENTATION as suggested in the WIKI. The problem is that we need a reference table to combine datasets with different presentations
2 - request that all information be transformed previously as whole fish by the national labs. The problem arises when gutted fish are sampled!!

My choice went to 1, I can live with 2 or better if someone has another solution, but we need to agree on a clear rule.

BR

Joel
