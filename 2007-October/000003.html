Liz Clarke a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would just like to clarify COST's approach to survey data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the COST proposal (pages 7-8) we specify we are estimating 
</I>&gt;<i> parameters in
</I>&gt;<i>         Module E - discards volume estimates
</I>&gt;<i>         Module H - length and age structure of the catches/landings
</I>&gt;<i>         Module I - other biological parameters
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since FRS only collects data for other biological parameters from 
</I>&gt;<i> research surveys rather than market/discard sampling (I think, apart 
</I>&gt;<i> from Nephrops which are sexed) I previously assumed that COST also 
</I>&gt;<i> covered research survey trawl data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, Joel's comment on the data exchange forum 26/09/07 implies 
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Concerning the survey data, they may be stored in a FF format but no 
</I>&gt;<i> methods addressing this issue will be developed within COST. There are 
</I>&gt;<i> different problems and different expertise to search here, but in 
</I>&gt;<i> Lisbon we can begin the discussion on the prospect of COST II.   
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, Joel's email &quot;[Cost-project-members] FF5_DEF structure&quot; on 
</I>&gt;<i> the members-mailing-list 10/10/07 refers to acoustic data. I presume 
</I>&gt;<i> this was a reference to FF5 formats in general rather than their 
</I>&gt;<i> specific application to COST - I wasn't aware we were going to 
</I>&gt;<i> consider acoustic data?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Am I right in thinking that COST does not apply to survey data? Closer 
</I>&gt;<i> reading of the definition of Module I other biological parameters in 
</I>&gt;<i> EU Reg 1639/2001 does not help (me) clarify this at all!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be very happy to discover that I've misunderstood, as it reduces 
</I>&gt;<i> the work load I thought we had to cover in COST. However, due to my 
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstanding, the text I drafted for the EDA package (WP3) 
</I>&gt;<i> includes specific mention of research survey data for other biological 
</I>&gt;<i> parameters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do we resolve this if we are not analysing survey data?
</I>&gt;<i> all the best
</I>&gt;<i> Liz
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>Hi Liz,

sorry for my lack of clarity in the message concerning the DEF and the 
acoustic data. I was refering there about the FF format in general as my 
demand was to create an independent CA table (and in that case this new 
CA would also be usable for the acoustic information).

My comment on the forum still stands : no work on survey catch data. 
More precisely, no index calculation and no raising procedures specific 
to surveys.

However, the population based data collected within a survey, such as 
the SMAWLK data, are to be dealt with in COST. This is under the 
biological parameters item (in each WP) and the information can be 
provided by different sources, including the surveys. The rules should 
be (to be discussed next week)

    * The sampling coverage has to take into account all the sources.
    * The merging of the different sources can be done provided that it
      is the same length class, same area and same time period. There is
      a specific function that will be developed (already done by
      Mathieu following Hans Gerritsen paper) to evaluate the
      similarities of the samples. It can be positioned in the EDA (to
      be discussed).
    * The population parameters (SMW at age) can only be estimated after
      combining the population length structure to the SMAWLK.
    * Like the age structure of a population, the variance of the
      estimates combines the internal variance of the SMAWLK and the
      variance of the length structure.

The only way it can work now is to avoid deriving a length structure of 
a population from survey catches. As I said in the forum, this could be 
in COST II, IF needed.

By drawing the WP frames during the sub-group work next week, it is such 
&quot;algorithms&quot; I want to be written and agreed.

Best regards.

Joel
