</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In the COST proposal (pages 7-8) we specify we are estimating

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>         Module E - discards volume estimates

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>         Module I - other biological parameters
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Since FRS only collects data for other biological parameters from 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> research surveys rather than market/discard sampling (I think, apart 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from Nephrops which are sexed) I previously assumed that COST also 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> covered research survey trawl data.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However, Joel's comment on the data exchange forum 26/09/07 implies
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> otherwise:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Concerning the survey data, they may be stored in a FF format but no 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> methods addressing this issue will be developed within COST. There 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are different problems and different expertise to search here, but in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Lisbon we can begin the discussion on the prospect of COST II.   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However, Joel's email &quot;[Cost-project-members] FF5_DEF structure&quot; on 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the members-mailing-list 10/10/07 refers to acoustic data. I presume 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this was a reference to FF5 formats in general rather than their 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> specific application to COST - I wasn't aware we were going to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> consider acoustic data?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Am I right in thinking that COST does not apply to survey data? 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Closer reading of the definition of Module I other biological 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> parameters in EU Reg 1639/2001 does not help (me) clarify this at all!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'll be very happy to discover that I've misunderstood, as it 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reduces the work load I thought we had to cover in COST. However, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> due to my misunderstanding, the text I drafted for the EDA package

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Liz,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sorry for my lack of clarity in the message concerning the DEF and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the acoustic data. I was refering there about the FF format in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general as my demand was to create an independent CA table (and in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that case this new CA would also be usable for the acoustic information).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My comment on the forum still stands : no work on survey catch data. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> More precisely, no index calculation and no raising procedures 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specific to surveys.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, the population based data collected within a survey, such as 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the SMAWLK data, are to be dealt with in COST. This is under the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> biological parameters item (in each WP) and the information can be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provided by different sources, including the surveys. The rules 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be (to be discussed next week)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     * The sampling coverage has to take into account all the sources.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     * The merging of the different sources can be done provided that it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       is the same length class, same area and same time period. There is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       a specific function that will be developed (already done by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       Mathieu following Hans Gerritsen paper) to evaluate the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       similarities of the samples. It can be positioned in the EDA (to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       be discussed).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     * The population parameters (SMW at age) can only be estimated after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       combining the population length structure to the SMAWLK.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     * Like the age structure of a population, the variance of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       estimates combines the internal variance of the SMAWLK and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       variance of the length structure.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The only way it can work now is to avoid deriving a length structure 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of a population from survey catches. As I said in the forum, this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be in COST II, IF needed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> By drawing the WP frames during the sub-group work next week, it is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such &quot;algorithms&quot; I want to be written and agreed.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with Joel about the CA tables. IMO we should have a parallel

Hi,
It's good that we are clear COST will use survey data for biological parameters. This means we need to agree the exchange format for survey data. Lisa is working on an extraction of Cefas survey data to the DATRAS format as this looks like the most developed idea.

Dear All

So it is clear that FishFrame and COST needs SMAWL data from trawl surveys, acoustic surveys and commercial fisheries samplings. COST 1 only contains full information from commercial fisheries data while FishFrame contains full information from all three. COST 2 might include all as well. 
We now have three well defined non-overlapping exchange formats for the sampling types (FF5.CS + FF5.AS + ICES.DATRAS).


So what to do?
Option 1:
We can create a new format for SMAWL and then use the other formats for HLs only. Then we would not need to create separate methods for reading the three formats into COST 1 (although we might have to do it in COST 2). This would be the easiest solution seen solely from the COST project side.

Option 2:
We can use the three formats for exchanging the data including the SMAWL data, and if needed (for COST) the formats can be used without adding the HL records. FishFrame stores the whole structure while COST 1 only stores the SMAWL, this could be in one shared SMAWL table or in three separate. The storage (internal database structure) is not depending on the exchange formats.

Option 3 (a mix of 1 and 2):
COST could use the CS format for SMAWL while additional SMAWLs from surveys would then be added in a new format. Inside COST we can keep them separate or in the same table as we want.


What option to choose?
In all three options FishFrame and COST applications can then let the user decide what SMAWL data to include during analysis, this is independent of exchange format and database design.

Seen from the data provider side, then option 2 is preferable because, the national data centers only needs to make sure that they extract and maintain one set of data. Having multiple versions of the same data in different overlapping formats easily leads to errors and outdated data.

Seen from the data quality perspective, I personally think data quality checking becomes more transparent and stronger when the types are kept apart in the more streamlined way (option 2). 
By the way we will add a feature on the FishFrame, that makes users able to validate their exchange files without uploading them. This is mainly for COST users and others who use same formatting. This can only be used if we have similar formats.

There is also some stratification issues to deal with. The age-length keys are different for different EU-size-sorting categories and for landed part vs. discarded part (see attached file). This makes the format for commercial SMAWL and survey SMAWL different pointing towards option 2 or 3.

Best regards
Teunis
