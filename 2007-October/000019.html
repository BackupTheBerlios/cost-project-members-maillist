</I>Hi Joel,

I think your summary is correct but I'd like to elaborate a little bit 
more on CA tables.

This information comes from 3 different sources, (i) market sampling, 
(ii) on-board sampling and (iii) surveys, which differ in their 
aggregation level. Most aggregated is market sampling where area and 
time units are, at the most, rectangle and day. After we have on-board 
sampling where sometimes its possible to have coordinates and time in 
hour:minutes. The most disaggregated is survey data where we have 
coordinates and time. The information related with the individual is the 
same for all, although sometimes there are some missing observations 
(one may sample age and not maturity, etc).

Based on this rationale we may create a data structure that combines 
area, rectangle, coordinates, day, hour with data source (this is 
similar to sampling type so we may use that field):

sampType; area, rectangle, latIni, lonIni, latFin, lonFin, dateIni, 
dateFin, hourIni, hourFin, stock, spp, sex, etc (country, length, age, 
blah blah blah)

area, rectangle and dateFin would be mandatory so that market sampling 
can be included and the other fields would be filled based on sampType. 
A survey could provide everything lat, lon, hour, etc, while on-board 
sampling could provide some of this information. This way we could 
develop a data structure for individual biopars and link with CS using 
rectangle, date, spp etc.

My doubts are:

1) although biopars are independent from the fishery we know that the 
selectivity of the gear can bias the sampling, so I guess we should keep 
some information about the gear used to collect the sample;
2) how far can we go with this and still keep compatibility with FF ? A 
change like this would require some adjustments to FF5 and FF5 exchange 
format. Are you whiling to do it ? Otherwise it makes no sense 
implementing only in COST and we should just keep it as it is now.

IMO if we go this path we should stop developing CA for now, discuss the 
data structure until we have an agreement and after implement FF5, FF5 
exchange format and COST classes. In the mean time other packages could 
move on with length frequencies methods.

Best
