Subject: [Cost-project-members] size categories

Can anyone clarify this:

In Scotland (and probably other countries as well) the size category is 
not nationally defined, instead it is something determined by the 
individual boats. So there could be anything up to 6 size categories on 
any one boat, and size 3 say would not be the same as on any other boat.


This means that when length samples are taken it is necessary to record 
the number of fish in the size category from which they are taken. This 
usually means one box is taken for length  measurements, and  the number

of boxes of that size class on the boat is recorded. 

However, I can't see how this will be recorded in the COST format. In
the SL record there are weight and subsample weight fields, but the
comments to the weight field say that for market sampling the &quot;catch
weight is per definition equal to sample weight&quot;. What does this mean,
and how will the size category weight be recorded?

Also, it would be really nice if  there was some more data available. 
Particularly data including discards would be helpful. There isn't any 
at the moment as far as I can tell.

Hi David 

Yes in the Scottish demersal fleet size classes are quite arbitrary and
not standard between vessels. So they will usually be something like
&quot;whole&quot; then &quot;small&quot; &quot;medium&quot; and &quot;large&quot; gutted. But what constitutes a
&quot;large&quot; fish for example is dependant on the trip, vessel, species, time
of year etc etc. 

In our market sampling procedure one box will be taken from each size
class and the lengths taken from all the fish in that box. Also the
weight of that box. 
Landed weight for that size class is number of boxes landed x sampled
box weight. 

In COST format I have translated this as, in the sl table, weight ($wt)
is my total landed weight for the size class and subsample weight
($subSampWt) the weight of the sampled box. Commercial size category
($commCat) is 1, 2,3, .. depending on the number of size classes. 
But a 1 for one trip is not necessarily the same as a 1 for another
trip. 
And (obviously) each tr - hh record has as many sl records as there were
commercial size classes landed. Total landed weight for the species on
the trip is the sum of $wt over the sl tables. 

I agree &quot;For Market sampling: Catch weight is per definition equal to
Sample weight&quot; does not make any sense in our context. 

All the best
Alastair
