</I>&gt;<i> Hi David,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would advise to use the packages, to be in the same conditions as the final users, and open the CVS files to understand how the functions you are using are implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> By doing this, if you find a bug in a function you can either point out exactly where the problem is or propose a solution by testing a new code only on the given function.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, I wanted to know where the developers are, with regards design-based and model-based packages. 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have all the elements you need to work? 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have the physical time to resume the discussions we had on the raising procedures. I hope this is not too much of a problem at this stage, and that this will be sorted out before the meeting in June.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards

</I>&gt;<i> ----------------------------------

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Joel, I think the COSTCore and COSTeda packages now allow us to start on the design based estimates, although we need to check the post-stratification is ok to use. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've attached the list of actions that we agreed at the first project meeting, so it's the responsibility of all members of the project to agree the methods and for me, Marcel, Paz and Mathieu to produce the code.
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;&lt;WP4 tasks draft v1_rev JV.xls&gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two immediate actions
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Paz and Marcel please email to say if you are ready to start or if you have any questions or problems about setting up the COSTCore and COSTeda packages and Tortoise CVS and WinMerge to share code via our berlios website.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. All, Confirm a name for the package - is COSTdbe (short for design-based estimates) ok or does anyone have other suggestions? 
</I>&gt;<i>  (Fitting a maturity ogive is a model based estimate if we worry about the details)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then, I think we should use the open-source coding approach - do something now then modify it:
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Paz, Mathieu  I would really like the proportion mature estimates to be done first so suggest we work on them together. If we can produce the code before 30th May it can be used at the WKMOG meeting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Machel, I suggest coding a prototype for the catch numbers at age rather than waiting for the discussions about how to weight the estimates to conclude. You could use either your institute's raising procedure or the one in Joel's working document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the best from sunny Lowestoft!
</I>&gt;<i> David
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Hi all,

thanks David for your organisational email. I wish to read the response 
to your queries from all the persons you have named in your message (be 
it negative, positive, critical or even providing solutions,...).

It's Ok for me to chose COSTdbe for this package

Concerning the implementation, here are some points :
1 - For proportion mature estimates (as for sex-ratio), we need 
maturity-at-length and maturity-at-age estimated at the population 
level. The M-at-length estimates is straightforward as we can use the 
information available in the CA table as such, but it is not always the 
case for M-at-age. If the information in the CA is coming from a random 
sampling of the population itself (scientific survey) then we can take 
this for granted and calculate directly M-at-Age. If not, we need to 
weight the M-at-Length we have in the CA by the length structure of the 
population. This we don't have, but we have a length structure of the 
catches (see point 2) which can be used for the ages fully recruited. My 
point would be not to try to do what we cannot do or force the system, 
at the exception of the assumption that under a certain L, all 
individuals are considered Immature.

2 -Mathieu has developed some analytical estimates of the length 
structure from market sampling (for Ifremer use) based on the COST 
objects, so I ask him to tell the group (especially for Marcel) which 
functions he already wrote and provide the code to the group. As a 
general statement, always make use of already defined functions in COST, 
(at least internally within the package and those defined in COSTcore 
and COSTeda).

3 - We are not talking here about GLM or any kind of modelling. It is 
design-based estimates of the means at length/age and the associated 
variances.

Best regards

Joel
