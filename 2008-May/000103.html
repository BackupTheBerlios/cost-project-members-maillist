Subject: Re: [cost-devel] CVS and packages





Hi David,



I would advise to use the packages, to be in the same conditions as the
final users, and open the CVS files to understand how the functions you are
using are implemented.

By doing this, if you find a bug in a function you can either point out
exactly where the problem is or propose a solution by testing a new code
only on the given function.



By the way, I wanted to know where the developers are, with regards
design-based and model-based packages. 

Do you have all the elements you need to work? 

I don't have the physical time to resume the discussions we had on the
raising procedures. I hope this is not too much of a problem at this stage,
and that this will be sorted out before the meeting in June.



Best regards



Joel

----------------------------------



Hi all,



Joel, I think the COSTCore and COSTeda packages now allow us to start on the
design based estimates, although we need to check the post-stratification is
ok to use. 



I've attached the list of actions that we agreed at the first project
meeting, so it's the responsibility of all members of the project to agree
the methods and for me, Marcel, Paz and Mathieu to produce the code.

 &lt;&lt;WP4 tasks draft v1_rev JV.xls&gt;&gt; 



Two immediate actions



1. Paz and Marcel please email to say if you are ready to start or if you
have any questions or problems about setting up the COSTCore and COSTeda
packages and Tortoise CVS and WinMerge to share code via our berlios
website.



2. All, Confirm a name for the package - is COSTdbe (short for design-based
estimates) ok or does anyone have other suggestions? 

 (Fitting a maturity ogive is a model based estimate if we worry about the
details)





Then, I think we should use the open-source coding approach - do something
now then modify it:

 

3. Paz, Mathieu  I would really like the proportion mature estimates to be
done first so suggest we work on them together. If we can produce the code
before 30th May it can be used at the WKMOG meeting.



4. Machel, I suggest coding a prototype for the catch numbers at age rather
than waiting for the discussions about how to weight the estimates to
conclude. You could use either your institute's raising procedure or the one
in Joel's working document.



All the best from sunny Lowestoft!

David



  

Hi all,

thanks David for your organisational email. I wish to read the response to
your queries from all the persons you have named in your message (be it
negative, positive, critical or even providing solutions,...).

It's Ok for me to chose COSTdbe for this package

Concerning the implementation, here are some points :
1 - For proportion mature estimates (as for sex-ratio), we need
maturity-at-length and maturity-at-age estimated at the population level.
The M-at-length estimates is straightforward as we can use the information
available in the CA table as such, but it is not always the case for
M-at-age. If the information in the CA is coming from a random sampling of
the population itself (scientific survey) then we can take this for granted
and calculate directly M-at-Age. If not, we need to weight the M-at-Length
we have in the CA by the length structure of the population. This we don't
have, but we have a length structure of the catches (see point 2) which can
be used for the ages fully recruited. My point would be not to try to do
what we cannot do or force the system, at the exception of the assumption
that under a certain L, all individuals are considered Immature.

2 -Mathieu has developed some analytical estimates of the length structure
from market sampling (for Ifremer use) based on the COST objects, so I ask
him to tell the group (especially for Marcel) which functions he already
wrote and provide the code to the group. As a general statement, always make
use of already defined functions in COST, (at least internally within the
package and those defined in COSTcore and COSTeda).

3 - We are not talking here about GLM or any kind of modelling. It is
design-based estimates of the means at length/age and the associated
variances.

Best regards

Joel

Hi all, 
 
Using the same scheme from David:
 

1. I have already installed the COSTCore and COSTeda packages, no problem,
but I must remember the lessons to use of Tortoise CVS and WinMerge to share
code via our berlios website. 

 

2. Name of package: I agree with COSTdbe.

 

3. Ok, we can start by the propotion mature estimates.

 

All the best,

 

Paz
