</I>&gt;<i> reviewed from the interim report
</I>&gt;<i> COSTeda : Code Ok. Man pages : to be reviewed. User Manual : to be

</I>&gt;<i> COSTdbe : Code : very close from verison 1.0 Man pages : to be

</I>&gt;<i> COSTmbe : Code : should have the first workable version this week Man

</I>&gt;<i> COSTsim : hardly started. This is the most problematic part!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm confident for us to be able to draft a final report for COSTcore, 
</I>&gt;<i> COSTeda, COSTdbe by the end of next week. I need to know what to do 
</I>&gt;<i> with COSTmbe and COSTsim. My proposal would be to draft an empty shell 
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. only text and only partly workable packages which will be filled 
</I>&gt;<i> during the following weeks, knowing that the external reviewers will 
</I>&gt;<i> take some time to do their work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I strongly apologise for this. I can take on my shoulders as much as 
</I>&gt;<i> possible and stop immediatly everything else I'm working on, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> need a strong help from everyone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first is that all developers spend time on filling completely the 
</I>&gt;<i> man pages of their methods. The second is to provide me with examples 
</I>&gt;<i> of code that works so that I can focus on the user manual. The third 
</I>&gt;<i> is for the leaders of packages to compile a version 1 of their package 
</I>&gt;<i> before the end of next week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you in advance and again sorry for this kind of ... fish tail 
</I>&gt;<i> ending!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards

Hi Joel,

COSTcore passes the R check :-)

I'll revised the man pages asap.

Regarding the Manual I suggest we don't make a manual for each package. 
R man pages are already a manual, see COSTcore attached.

Regarding the COST manual IMO we can compile the examples you have in a 
single document, insert comments and use Sweave to produce a hands-on 
manual. I suppose it will be much easier than starting from scratch and 
IMO it will be more useful.

Sweave is a R to LaTeX converter. Don't be scared or horrified with 
latex ;-) I'll be happy to edit the document and produce the pdf file. 
You'll have to include text in the example scripts explaining the 
analysis. Pretty much what you have now in R comments but a little more 
extended.

I'm attaching an experience I made with the first bit of the market 
example. See if you like it.

Best

EJ
