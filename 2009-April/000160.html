<PRE>Dear colleagues,

this is not an April fools day joke.
The Commission just reminded me to send the COST final report immediatly!!!
Following the terms of the contract, the final report must be provided 
one month before the end of the contract. This is something I really did 
not anticipate and thought we had all April to write this report. I have 
succeeded in providing us some days, i.e. until Friday 10 April.... I am 
talking about the report, not the project.

This is going to be a hell of a work. I'm going to start from the 
interim report and provide you by the end of the afternoon with the 
report frame. Concerning the packages,
COSTcore : Code Ok. Man pages : to be reviewed. User Manual : to be 
reviewed from the interim report
COSTeda : Code Ok. Man pages : to be reviewed. User Manual : to be 
reviewed from the interim report
COSTdbe : Code : very close from verison 1.0 Man pages : to be reviewed. 
User Manual : to be drafted
COSTmbe : Code : should have the first workable version this week Man 
pages : to be drafted. User Manual : to be drafted.
COSTsim : hardly started. This is the most problematic part!!

I'm confident for us to be able to draft a final report for COSTcore, 
COSTeda, COSTdbe by the end of next week. I need to know what to do with 
COSTmbe and COSTsim. My proposal would be to draft an empty shell i.e. 
only text and only partly workable packages which will be filled during 
the following weeks, knowing that the external reviewers will take some 
time to do their work.

I strongly apologise for this. I can take on my shoulders as much as 
possible and stop immediatly everything else I'm working on, but I need 
a strong help from everyone.

The first is that all developers spend time on filling completely the 
man pages of their methods. The second is to provide me with examples of 
code that works so that I can focus on the user manual. The third is for 
the leaders of packages to compile a version 1 of their package before 
the end of next week.

Thank you in advance and again sorry for this kind of ... fish tail ending!!

Best regards

Joel
